A buried session is a session that continues to run but is not a part of any window. If you have a long-running job that you want out of the way, it can be convenient to bury its session. It is used by default for the session where you initiate a tmux integration client using <a href="https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/TmuxIntegration">tmux Integration</a>.

To bury the current session, select **Session > Bury Session**. To restore a session, select it from the list of buried sessions in **Session > Buried Sessions**.
