This menu contains a list of profiles. Selecting one opens it in a new tab. Hold option while selecting a profile to open it in a new window, instead.

#### Profiles > Open Profiles...
This opens the "Profiles Window" which allows you to create new windows, tabs, or panes from one or more profiles. You can perform a search by entering text in the search field. Profile names and tags are searched, and the listed profiles are filtered as you type. You can use the up and down arrow keys to make a selection. Pressing enter will open a new tab, while shift-enter will open a new window. You can make multiple selections by holding down shift or cmd and clicking on profiles. The "New Tabs in New Window" button is enabled only when more than one profile is selected: it will open a new window and create a new tab for each profile selected.

#### Profiles > Open All
Opens all profiles in tabs (or in windows, if Option is pressed).
