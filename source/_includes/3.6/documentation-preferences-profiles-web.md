## Web

#### Page Zoom
Turn this up to increase the size of web pages to improve legibility.

#### Use /dev/null mode
A profile in this mode will be ephemeral. Information such as browsing history, cookies, or bookmarks are not saved to disk and disappear when the session is closed.

#### Enable Instant Replay
When enabled a screen capture video is constantly collected of the browser window. It respects the memory constraint in **Settings > General > Magic**. As with a terminal window you can review the video with **View > Start Instant Replay**
