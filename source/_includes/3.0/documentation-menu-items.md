This creates a new tab using the same profile as the current session rather than the default profile.

#### Edit > Paste Special > Advanced Paste
This opens the Advanced Paste window which lets you select a string from the pasteboard in recent history, select different representations of the current pasteboard, and modify the string before pasting it. You can modify it by appling a regex substitution, using various built-in modifiers (such as base-64 encoding), or edit it by hand.

#### Edit > Paste Special > Paste Selection
Pastes the currently selected text (which may differ from the text in the pasteboard).

#### Edit  > Paste Special > Paste File Base64-Encoded
If there is a file on the pasteboard then this is enabled. When invoked, it base64-encodes the file and pastes the encoded value.

#### Edit > Paste Special > Paste Escaping Special Characters
"Paste Escaping Special Characters" pastes the current string in the clipboard, but places a backslash before spaces and backslashes.

#### Edit > Edit Current Session

If you use <a href="shell_integration.html">Shell Integration</a> then Open Command History presents a list of recently used commands to select from.

"Open Paste History" opens a window showing up to the last 20 values that were copied or pasted in iTerm2. You can search its contents by typing a (non-necessarily-consecutive) subsequence of characters that appear in the value. You can use arrow keys and enter to make a selection, or you can click on an item to choose it, and it will be pasted. If you enable the Save copy/pate history to disk preference then these values will persist across sessions of iTerm2.

### View Menu

#### View > Show Tabs in Fullscreen
If enabled, tabs are shown in fullscreen windows.

#### View > Use Transparency

#### View > Find Cursor
Reveals the current cursor position.

#### View > Zoom In on Selection/Zoom Out

#### View > Open Quickly
If you have lots of sessions you can quickly find the one you're looking for with Open Quickly. Select the View > Open Quickly menu item (cmd-shift-O) and then enter a search query. You can search by tab title, command name, host name, user name, profile name, directory name, badge label, and more. Queries are scored according to relevance and sorted by score. Open Quickly also lets you create new tabs, change the current session's profile, and open arrangements. If you start your query with a / then that gives you a shortcut to various commands. /a followed by an arrangement name restores the arrangement. /f restricts the query to existing sessions, excluding options to open new tabs, etc. /p restrics the query to profile names to switch the current session to. /t restricts the results to "open new tab" for matching profile names.

#### View > Maximize Active Pane
When there are split panes present, this toggles whether a given pane expands to fill the tab. When a maximized pane is present, the tab will be inscribed with a dotted outline.

#### View > Start Instant Replay
Stepping through time allows you to see what was on the screen at a previous time. This is different than going back through the scrollback buffer, as interactive programs sometimes overwrite the screen contents without having them scroll back. Once in this mode, you can use the left and right arrow keys to step back and forward, respectively. The "esc" key exits this mode, as does clicking the close button in the bar that appears on the bottom. You can adjust the amount of memory dedicated to this feature in Preferences > Instant Replay uses xx MB per session. The more memory you assign, the further back in time you can step.

#### View > Tab Color
Allows you to select a tint color for the tab, to make it easier to distinguish. You can also change the tab color in Profiles > Preferences > Colors.

<hr/>
### Profiles Menu

#### Profiles > Open Profiles...
This opens the "Profiles Window" which allows you to create new windows, tabs, or panes from one or more profiles. You can perform a search by entering text in the search field. Profile names and tags are searched, and the listed profiles are filtered as you type. You can use the up and down arrow keys to make a selection. Pressing enter will open a new tab, while shift-enter will open a new window. You can make multiple selections by holding down shift or cmd and clicking on profiles. The "New Tabs in New Window" button is enabled only when more than one profile is selected: it will open a new window and create a new tab for each profile selected.

<hr/>

You must install <a href="shell_integration.html">Shell Integration</a> for this to know your directory history.

<hr/>
### Window Menu

#### Window > Exposé All Tabs
All iTerm2 tabs will be shown tiled on the main screen. You can mouse over a tab to see it larger, and clicking on it will restore the windows and select that tab and bring its window to the front. You can search the contents of all tabs by typing in the search field that appears on the left. Making a selection from the results below it will highlight the tab that contains that text. This is useful when you have many tabs open and can't find the one you're looking for.

#### Window > Save/Restore Window Arrangement
The current state and positions of windows, tabs, and spit panes is recorded and saved to disk with Save Window Arrangement. Restore Window Arrangement opens a new collection of windows having the saved state. You can automatically restore the arrangement in Preferences > General > Open saved window arrangement.
