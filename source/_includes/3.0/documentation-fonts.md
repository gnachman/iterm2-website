While iTerm2 does not require monospaced fonts, they look much better than proportionately spaced fonts. If you want to use Consolas, you may need to correct its baseline offset using a font editing tool.

iTerm2 has the capability of rendering text with thin strokes to improve readability. You can change how this works in the **Text** panel of the **Profiles** tab of **Preferences**.

You can also specify the a "non-ASCII" font in the **Text** panel of profile preferences. This font will be used for all code points greater than or equal to 128 or for characters with combining marks.
