## Shortcuts
<hr>

Shortcuts are quick ways to perform common tasks. There are various places in the UI where you can activate shortcuts:

* The Shortcuts toolbelt tool.
* The **Edit > Actions** menu.
* The **Actions Menu** and **Snippets Menu** status bar components.
* The **Open Quickly** panel.

### Actions

An action consists of something to do (such as open a new window) with a name, called its title. Actions are very similar to key bindings except that they don't need to have a keyboard shortcut attached.

### Snippets

A Snippet is a string of text with a title. By activating the snippet, the associated text is sent as though it had been typed.
