### Scripts Menu

If you have scripts located in `$HOME/Library/Application Support/iTerm2/Scripts` they'll be added to this menu. The menu will not exist if there are no scripts.

For backward compatibility, `$HOME/Library/Application Support/iTerm/Scripts` will be used if `$HOME/Library/Application Support/iTerm2/Scripts` does not exist.
