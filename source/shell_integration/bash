#

# General Usage:
#
#  1. Source this file at the end of your bash profile so as not to interfere
#     with anything else that's using PROMPT_COMMAND.
#
#  2. Add any precmd or preexec functions by appending them to their arrays:
#       e.g.
#       precmd_functions+=(my_precmd_function)
#       precmd_functions+=(some_other_precmd_function)
#
#       preexec_functions+=(my_preexec_function)
#
#  3. Consider changing anything using the DEBUG trap or PROMPT_COMMAND
#     to use preexec and precmd instead. Preexisting usages will be
#     preserved, but doing so manually may be less surprising.
#
#  Note: This module requires two Bash features which you must not otherwise be
#  using: the "DEBUG" trap, and the "PROMPT_COMMAND" variable. If you override
#  either of these after bash-preexec has been installed it will most likely break.

    # communicate to the outside world.
    # Instead, we have this workaround. We save the original value of PS1 in
    # $ITERM_ORIG_PS1. Then each time this function is run (it's called from

    # set PS1 from a PROMPT_COMMAND that runs just before us. Setting ITERM_ORIG_PS1

    # never make it into ITERM_ORIG_PS1. Issue 4532. It's important to check
