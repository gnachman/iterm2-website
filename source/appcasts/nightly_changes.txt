2024-10-23: Make dynamic profiles rewritable. Issue 11931

2024-10-23: Add advanced setting to disallow dragging by the
Add Tab button. Issue 11933

2024-10-22: Add SearchEngine. This moves the logic for
search into a new object and out of VT100Screen. It has the
ability to do the CPU-intensive work of searching in a
separate dispatch queue to unburden the main thread.

2024-10-17: Fix a bug where non-ansi colors were in the
hue/chroma vis

2024-10-17: Don't crash if a profile is missing ANSI colors.
Issue 11915.

2024-10-17: Update libssh2 to version 1.11.1

2024-10-17: When realizing a read-only copy of MarkCache,
some marks won't have entries yet. This happens because the
side-effect that adds the mark to the interval tree can run
after a side effect that uses the mark cache (e.g.,
setReturnCodeOfLastCommand). The early realization of the
mark cache caused no-entry marks to be dropped. This was
wrong, leading to a bug where the offscreen command line was
incorrect because the wrong mark was retrieved. This commit
changes MarkCache to track dropped marks and to add them to
`sorted` when they are found to have an interval. This check
is done before using `sorted` to ensure it is up to date. It
could be slow but in practice I doubt there will ever be
more than one dropped mark at a time. Issue 11904

2024-10-17: Carve out an exception for unicode hex input
since it doesn't use marked text so that we can avoid
sending control sequences in modifyOtherKeys mode when the
user is typing hex digits. Issue 11905

2024-10-17: Allow reporting scroll events in background
windows. Issue 11866

2024-10-16: Add support for Gemini. Issue 11900

gone on for 10 commands. Issue 11912

2024-10-15: Fix debug-only race condition with AATree's
debug journal

2024-10-15: Fix a bug in dynamic profiles where colors are
not respected if the parent profile has separate light/dark
colors enabled but the flag isn't set in the child profile.
See mailing list post with subject Importing profiles from
the command line

2024-10-15: Clear the number of wrapped lines in the
per-raw-line cache of the first raw line in LineBlock when
dropping lines. Hopefully fixes a common crash. For the sake
of safety, also clear it in setBufferStartOffset. If the
metadata array is empty, don't try to dereference the first
item when clearing the cache. Improve debug logging in case
it isn't actually fixed.

2024-10-15: Add SentinelOne checking to Sparkle.

Before installing an app update, check if SentinelAgent is
running. If so, wait 10 seconds and re-validate the
extracted app bundle.

Additionally, if the original app was code signed then the
update bundle must also be code signed. See the conversation
here:

- Deprecate key bindings for function/arrow keys. Add a
migration to remove them from profiles. Update preset
keyboard mappings to remove them.  - Remove old dumb code to
make control+page up/down scroll. This conflicts with the
defaults for window tiling in Sequoia.

2024-10-10: Print usage when you run iTerm2 --help

2024-09-26: Add debugging code

2024-09-26: Do not mutate Interval lengths in place. Remove
and re-add the items. Fixes a bug where maxLimitAtSubtree
could be wrong.

2024-09-26: Fix a bug in AATree/IntervalTree where the max
limit was wrong when updating deleted nodes. I think the
deleted nodes had bad parent pointers after a skew. I was
also failing to update all parents, and I failed to add a
node to the list of changed nodes when doing a removal in
some cases.

2024-09-07: Add context menu to edit snippets window
controller

2024-09-06: Fix vertical alignment of box-drawing characters
in the presence of vertical spacing. I think the problem was
that the text renderer centers glyphs within their
cell-including-spacing, which requires shifting glyphs by
half the height of the extra spacing but that logic was not
properly replicated in iTermCharacterSource. This commit
carefully ensures we draw the glyph in exactly the rect that
the text renderer expects it to be in. Issue 11478

2024-09-06: Fix a bug where the most recent mark sometimes
couldn't be found

2024-09-06: Update AI URL when changing model. Issue 11836

2024-09-06: Improve tooltip for command selection. Issue
11834

2024-09-06: In modifyOtherKeys mode 1, option-return should
send esc-return. This pleases emacs. I don't think xterm
implements its own spec correctly when it comes to this, so
it's just the wild west here. Issue 11833

2024-09-06: Improve script-with-input-logging

2024-09-05: Hide offscreen command line when the last

11817

2024-09-04: Make all find panel actions work when any
textview inside a PseudoTerminal is in the responder chain.
Fixes a bug where a search field in the status bar didn't
let you do find panel actions such as cmd-f to re-select its
contents. Issue 10551

2024-09-04: When saving a window arrangement with all
windows, sort window controllers by window number (the
shortcut number) so they'll have the same partial order when
restored. Issue 11813

2024-09-04: Don't assume VS16 has to be immediately after
the base character to force emoji presentation. Also accept
skintone modifier as a way to force emoji presentation.
