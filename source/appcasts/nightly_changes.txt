2025-12-19: Tweak position and spacing of stoplight buttons
in minimal in macOS 26. I can't do what apple wants, which
is for the red button to be concentric with the window
radius, because then the title and shortcut label would be
weirdly high or weirdly unaligned since my tabbar is taller
than standard. Hopefully the departure of Alan Dye will fix
my problems because someone who uses computers can design
this stuff. Issue 12474

design (#543)


2025-12-01: Add .claude/*.local.json to gitignore (#544)

Local Claude Code settings should not be committed to
version control.  This allows developers to maintain
personal Claude Code preferences while keeping shared
configuration (like custom commands) in the repository.
2025-12-01: Add configurable new instance open style
preference (#537)

Introduce a new advanced setting 'newInstanceOpenStyle' to
control how new iTerm2 instances are opened when triggered
by scripts or external applications. This setting allows
users to specify whether new instances open in a new window,
new tab (default), vertical split pane, or horizontal split
pane, providing a more flexible and unified configuration.
Updated the application delegate to respect this setting
when opening files.

2025-11-30: add customizable source pane colors (#535)

Introduce advanced settings for split pane source fill,
border, and inner border colors. Update SplitSelectionView
to use these settings, allowing users to customize the
appearance of the source pane during split pane move or swap
operations.  2025-11-30:  fix(profile-list-view): update row
heights only on width change (#538)

Modify the logic in ProfileListView to update row heights
only when the table view's width actually changes,
preventing unnecessary recalculations. This addresses
potential performance issues and avoids redundant updates
when the delegate is present but the width remains the same.

Reasons: - sources/ProfileListView.m: Changed conditional to
check for width change before updating row heights.  -
Improves efficiency by reducing unnecessary row height
updates.  2025-11-30:  fix(psmtabbarcontrol): sync add tab
button appearance with style (#540)

Ensure the add tab button's appearance is updated alongside
the overflow popup button when the background color changes.
This maintains visual consistency in the tab bar control,
especially in dark mode or when custom styles are applied.

split pane. Issue 12624

2025-11-24: Fix Kitty image protocol showing wrong image for
Unicode placeholders. Issue 12626

  - Use image identifier (i=) instead of imageNumber (I=)
  for virtual
    placement lookups. The identifier is unique; imageNumber
    is optional and often zero.

  - Fix variable shadowing in
  iTermFindKittyImageDrawForVirtualPlaceholder:
    the fallback lookup referenced nil 'draw' instead of
    'element', causing image ID lookups to always fail.

  - Change sentinel for optional third diacritic from 0 to
  -1. Diacritic
    index 0 is valid, so using 0 as "unset" prevented
    parsing the image ID MSB.

  - Only match by placementID when non-zero; zero means "use
  imageID"
    rather than "match draws with placementID 0".

  - Update iTermMetalPerFrameState to use the corrected
  lookup function
    when creating KittyImageRuns.
