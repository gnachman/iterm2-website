2026-02-26: Revert d651e3a54 to restore BCE behavior. Issue
12723

This reverts commit d651e3a54 ("Use defaults rather than
current SGR color when scrolling lines into view").

The reverted commit broke BCE (Background Color Erase)
compliance, which vim relies on. When vim sets a background
color and scrolls, it expects scrolled-in lines to use the
current SGR background color.  After the reverted commit,
scrolled-in lines used terminal defaults instead, causing
inconsistent background colors in vim.

BCE behavior: when new lines scroll into view, they are
filled with the current SGR background color (via grid's
defaultChar). This is synchronized from the terminal before
each token executes.

Added unit tests for BCE behavior: -
testBCE_ScrollingUsesDefaultCharBackgroundColor -
testBCE_ScrollRectUsesDefaultCharBackgroundColor

Note: This may reintroduce the behavior reported in issue
12512, where scrolled-in lines retain their background color
after SGR 49 reset. However, this is correct BCE behavior -
SGR 49 affects future operations, not cells already written
during scroll.

2026-02-25: Refactor window layout calculation into
iTermLayoutCalculator. Issue 12724

Extract layout logic from iTermRootTerminalView into a pure
iTermLayoutCalculator class for testability. This fixes a
bug where the tab bar height was double-deducted when
calculating the toolbelt frame in fullscreen.

The bug occurred because two mechanisms could both subtract
tab bar height: 1. shouldLeaveEmptyAreaAtTop added it to
decorationHeightTop 2.
tabViewFrameByShrinkingForFullScreenTabBar shrunk the frame

These are now mutually exclusive - if
shouldLeaveEmptyAreaAtTop is true, the frame shrinking is
skipped.

Also rename rootTerminalViewWindowHasFullSizeContentView to
rootTerminalViewFullScreenTabBarAccessoryOverlapsContent for
clarity.

2026-02-25: Don't harmonize colors by default. Although it's
a win for most users, I can't handle the amount of feedback

2026-02-25: Fix status bar hidden behind tab bar in
fullscreen. Issue 12724

When entering Lion fullscreen with multiple tabs, the status
bar was positioned behind the tab bar accessory view, making
it invisible.

The root cause traces back to commit e04f9988e which changed
rootTerminalViewShouldLeaveEmptyAreaAtTop to return NO when
the tab bar is a titlebar accessory. This was correct: when
the tab bar is an accessory, we shouldn't add its height to
decorationHeights.top because the tab bar is outside the
content view.

However, on windows with fullSizeContentView (determined by
savedWindowType), the titlebar accessory overlaps the
content view.  The tab view frame was already being adjusted
for this overlap via
tabViewFrameByShrinkingForFullScreenTabBar:window:, but the
status bar's containing frame was not.

The fix applies the same frame shrinking to the status bar's
containing frame, ensuring consistent positioning of all
subviews when the tab bar is a fullscreen titlebar accessory
that overlaps the content.

2026-02-23: Fix rawLine: and offsetOfRawLine: ignoring

Both methods hardcoded linenum == 0  start = 0 instead of

After dropLines advances _firstEntry and sets
bufferStartOffset to a non-zero value, they returned a
pointer/offset that started too early in the buffer, reading
dropped data and missing the tail of live data.

The fix mirrors the existing correct logic in
_lineRawOffset: and lengthOfRawLine:.

2026-02-15: Improve stress test isolation and cleanup

- Rename default suite from com.iterm2.defaults to
com.iterm2.stress-test for clarity - Track the test iTerm2's
PID and use it for cleanup instead of AppleScript quit
(avoids killing the wrong instance) - Remove restorable
state directory before launching to ensure clean startup

Improve stress_load.py robustness and remove throttling:

- Add defensive checks in flood mode: initialize proc before
try block,
  handle FileNotFoundError, check proc exists before
  terminating
- Add thread safety to title injection with a lock to
prevent races
  between timer callbacks and cancellation
- Simplify mode iteration tracking with mode_start_iteration
variable - Remove 1ms sleep every 100 iterations; let PTY
backpressure provide
  natural throttling for more realistic stress testing

2026-02-15: Add performance testing infrastructure (PR 569)

Core components: - run_stress_test.sh: Main harness with tab
count sweeps, synchronized startup, DTrace metrics,
interaction injection, suite presets - stress_load.py:
Terminal output generator with multiple modes (normal,
buffer, clearcodes, flood) for exercising text processing -
Dashboard-style modes (htop, watch, progress, table, status)
for cursor positioning stress - analyze_profile.py: Profiler
output analysis for hotspot detection - tmux_wrapper.sh:
Auto-cleanup tmux session management

Self-time profiling (--self-time): - iterm_self_time.d:
DTrace script with explicit section markers, duration/sample
metadata, tick-based self-termination -
analyze_self_time.py: Distinguishes raw leaf time from
attributed callers, normalizes module names, reports
coverage honestly

DTrace integration: - Frame rate and UX metrics collection
scripts - FairnessScheduler probes - Proper dtrace
sequencing: -p before -s, attach detection via polling,
SIGINT before quit for clean END block output - Use /tmp for
sync dir with chmod 777 for root dtrace access

Environment validation: - Check iTerm2 not running at script
start - Detect power source and energy mode via pmset - Warn
if not on AC power or high power mode - Capture build
metadata (version, commit, branch, date) from app plist

Suite presets (--suite=): - com.iterm2.defaults: Default
preferences - com.iterm2.fairness: Fairness scheduler

2026-02-15: FEAT: Add color picker and recent colors to tab
color menu (#578)

* Add custom color picker and recent colors to tab color
menu

Add an eyedropper icon to the tab color menu that opens
NSColorPanel for picking any custom color. Show the current
custom color as a swatch with checkmark when it differs from
presets. Persist up to 12 recent tab colors in
NSUserDefaults and display them as an accessory view in the
color panel. Debounce saving while dragging in the picker to
avoid flooding recents with near-identical colors.

* Use CPKPopover for tab color picker and move delegate to
Swift

Move ColorsMenuItemViewDelegate conformance from
PseudoTerminal.m to PseudoTerminal.swift. Use CPKPopover as
the default color picker with NSColorPanel as a fallback,
respecting the kCPKUseSystemColorPicker user preference. Fix
popover anchoring to the actual tab cell.  Increase max
recent tab colors from 12 to 14.

Also fix a pre-existing bug in ColorsMenuItemView.m where
MAX(1, ...) was used instead of MIN(1, ...) for saturation
clamping in the swatch outline color, causing saturation to
always clamp to 1.0.

* Replace associated objects with ObjC property, fix curly
quotes 2026-02-15: Make builds more contributor-friendly
(#582)

* Make builds more contributor-friendly

builds - Default to native-arch-only deps; pass UNIVERSAL=1
for fat binaries - Derive BUILD_DIR dynamically from
xcodebuild with fail-fast validation - Discover rustup via
PATH instead of hardcoding /opt/homebrew/bin/rustup -
Normalize paranoid-* target names to
paranoid-<exact-target-name> - Remove stale targets (Dep,
canary, debug, paranoidrailroad, paranoidsclv) - Propagate
SIGNING_FLAGS and ARCH_FLAGS to sub-Makefiles

* Pass SIGNED=1 UNIVERSAL=1 in release scripts

The Makefile now defaults to unsigned native-arch builds for
contributors. Release scripts need to opt in to signing and
universal binaries explicitly.

* Remove obsolete release scripts

Delete six scripts that are relics of previous release
workflows: - full_release.sh, full_release2.sh:
svn/googlecode era - notarize.sh: deprecated xcrun altool
helper - release_preview.sh: references Growl, OS 10.8+,
ruby signing - release_beta_built.sh: deprecated xcrun
altool notarization - continuous.sh: untouched since 2014,
replaced by GitHub Actions CI

2026-02-07: [CHERRY PICK TO 3.6.7] Fix paste bracketing race
condition causing out-of-order chunks. Issue 12704

Bug: When pasting multi-line text with bracketed paste mode
enabled, the first chunk (containing ESC[200~ start bracket)
could arrive after subsequent chunks, causing applications
like nano to hang.

Root cause: Commit e0a6352 moved the first chunk write into
the willExpect callback to ensure the expectation was
installed before writing. However, this callback is invoked
via a chain of dispatch_async calls (sync  updateExpectFrom
copy  addExpectation  dispatch_async).  The paste timer
could fire before this chain completed, writing subsequent
chunks directly while the first chunk was still pending.

Fix: Queue the first chunk synchronously before dispatching
sync, using a reference counter (bracketedPastePending) to
also queue subsequent chunks. When willExpect fires,
bracketedPasteDidExpect decrements the counter and flushes
the queue if all blocking conditions are cleared
(_buffering, sendingIsBlocked, bracketedPastePending).

This ensures: - First chunk is in queue before any
subsequent chunks - All writes respect existing queuing
conditions - Correct ordering is preserved when the queue is
flushed

2026-01-31: Support git diff index/worktree path prefixes in
semantic history (#572)

* Support git diff index/worktree path prefixes (i/, w/, c/,
o/) in semantic history path cleaning

Extend pathByRemovingDiffPrefix to handle all git diff path
prefixes documented in git-diff(1), not just a/ and b/. This
fixes an issue where paths from git diff output using index
(i/) and worktree (w/) prefixes were incorrectly treated as
URLs instead of file paths.

Git diff can use various prefixes depending on the command:
- a/ and b/ - traditional diff format (old/new files) - i/
and w/ - index and worktree (git diff
--ita-visible-in-index) - c/ - commit - o/ - object

Add comprehensive tests for all new prefix types following
the existing test pattern for a/ and b/ prefixes.

* Refactor git diff prefix tests to use parameterized loop

Consolidate 6 separate test methods
(testGetFullPathStripsLeading{A,B,I,W,C,O}Slash) into a
single parameterized test that loops over all git diff
prefixes. This follows the existing pattern used in
testGetFullPathStripsDelimiters and
testGetFullPathStripsTrailingPunctuation.

Benefits: - Reduces code duplication (from ~110 lines to ~20
lines) - Easier to maintain - adding new prefixes requires
one line instead of a full test method - Maintains test
coverage for all 6 git diff prefixes (a/, b/, i/, w/, c/,
o/) - Adds descriptive assertion messages showing which
prefix failed if a test fails 2026-01-31: Add repair button

under lastImageKey in transmissionDidFinish(), but the
lookup after transmission always used the identifier
directly, causing "ENOENT:Image not found after
transmission" errors.

This fix makes the lookup behavior consistent with storage:
use lastImageKey when identifier is 0, matching how
executeDisplayCommand already handles this case.
2026-01-23: Prevent deadlock is VT100ScreenMutableState is
dealloced during a paused side effect

2026-01-22: Centralize join context coordination in iTermGCD
(#562)

- Move gPerformingJoinedBlock from VT100ScreenMutableState.m
to iTermGCD.m - Add comprehensive documentation explaining
coordination signals:
  - Join context (joined, performingJoinedBlock) - Queue
  safety markers (for assertions) - Related state in
  TokenExecutor (pauseCount, executingSideEffects, etc.)
- Preserve atomic exchange semantics for
setPerformingJoinedBlock: - Add forwarding accessors in
VT100ScreenMutableState for compatibility

2026-01-21: Re-enable GCD timer on macOS 26 (#564)

The macOS 26 check that disabled GCD timer was added for
issue 12415, but the root cause was actually
NSAutoFillHeuristicController causing performance
degradation (see Ghostty PR 8625). That issue is already
addressed by disabling NSAutoFillHeuristicControllerEnabled.

Testing shows GCD timer achieves ~24fps while NSTimer only
achieves ~16fps at the 30fps cadence setting, due to
aggressive timer coalescing by macOS when no tolerance is
set. GCD timer's explicit 0.5ms tolerance prevents this
coalescing.

2026-01-21: Fix adaptive framerate always overriding
non-adaptive setting (#565)

A refactoring in 29b3a39d9 (April 2019) converted nested
if-else logic to early returns but missed adding a return
after the non-adaptive framerate path. This caused the
adaptive framerate code to always run and override the
cadence, even when useAdaptiveFrameRate was false.

The result was that disabling adaptive framerate had no
effect - users would still get the slow adaptive cadence
(15fps for non-Metal, 30fps for Metal) instead of the
configured active update cadence.

Cache bidi preference lookup using FAST_BOOL_ACCESSOR. Issue

2026-01-18: Cache margin preferences using FAST_INT_ACCESSOR
(#553)

* Cache margin preferences using FAST_INT_ACCESSOR

Add FAST_INT_ACCESSOR pattern to cache integer preferences
similar to existing FAST_BOOL_ACCESSOR. Apply to sideMargins
and topBottomMargins which are called 55 times per render
frame in the drawing hot path.

- Add iTermPreferencesIntCache struct - Add
FAST_INT_ACCESSOR macro - Add intWithCache: method - Add
sideMargins and topBottomMargins fast accessors - Update 29
call sites in iTermTextDrawingHelper.m - Update 26 call
sites in PTYTextView.m

* Use cached preference accessors in Metal renderers

Replace direct intForKey:/boolForKey: calls with fast cached
accessors (sideMargins, topBottomMargins,
maximizeThroughput) in Metal rendering code.

These preferences are read every frame at 60+ FPS. While the
per-call savings are modest, eliminating NSUserDefaults lock
acquisition reduces contention with other threads (main
thread, mutation queue) that also access preferences.

Files changed: - iTermMetalDriver.m: topBottomMargins,
maximizeThroughput - iTermMetalCellRenderer.m: sideMargins,
topBottomMargins - iTermMarkRenderer.m: sideMargins

* Cache session configuration preference lookups

Add FAST_BOOL_ACCESSOR for allowClipboardAccessFromTerminal
and dimOnlyText preferences, used in
updateConfigurationFields hot path.

These preferences are accessed every frame during rendering
and benefit from the same dispatch_once caching pattern used
for other hot-path preferences.
