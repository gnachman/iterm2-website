nullable rawLine: pointer passed to OffsetOfWrappedLine -
Add explicit type annotation to closure parameter for type

2026-02-07: [CHERRY PICK TO 3.6.7] Fix paste bracketing race
condition causing out-of-order chunks. Issue 12704

Bug: When pasting multi-line text with bracketed paste mode
enabled, the first chunk (containing ESC[200~ start bracket)
could arrive after subsequent chunks, causing applications
like nano to hang.

Root cause: Commit e0a6352 moved the first chunk write into
the willExpect callback to ensure the expectation was
installed before writing. However, this callback is invoked
via a chain of dispatch_async calls (sync  updateExpectFrom
copy  addExpectation  dispatch_async).  The paste timer
could fire before this chain completed, writing subsequent
chunks directly while the first chunk was still pending.

Fix: Queue the first chunk synchronously before dispatching
sync, using a reference counter (bracketedPastePending) to
also queue subsequent chunks. When willExpect fires,
bracketedPasteDidExpect decrements the counter and flushes
the queue if all blocking conditions are cleared
(_buffering, sendingIsBlocked, bracketedPastePending).

This ensures: - First chunk is in queue before any
subsequent chunks - All writes respect existing queuing
conditions - Correct ordering is preserved when the queue is
flushed

full.

Fix several bugs in resize code: - safeCoordRange: check
start.x (not end.x twice) for validation.  - promptRange
modulo: fix end.x %= end.x (always 0) to end.x %= width.  -
positionRangeForCoordRange: handle lines shorter than the
screen width.  - updateSavedIntervalTreeWithWidth: update
VT100ScreenMark's
  commandRange, promptRange, and outputStart when resizing
  marks in the saved (alt screen) interval tree, matching
  what updateIntervalTreeWithWidth already does for the
  primary tree.

2026-01-31: Support git diff index/worktree path prefixes in
semantic history (#572)

* Support git diff index/worktree path prefixes (i/, w/, c/,
o/) in semantic history path cleaning

Extend pathByRemovingDiffPrefix to handle all git diff path
prefixes documented in git-diff(1), not just a/ and b/. This
fixes an issue where paths from git diff output using index
(i/) and worktree (w/) prefixes were incorrectly treated as
URLs instead of file paths.

Git diff can use various prefixes depending on the command:
- a/ and b/ - traditional diff format (old/new files) - i/
and w/ - index and worktree (git diff
--ita-visible-in-index) - c/ - commit - o/ - object

Add comprehensive tests for all new prefix types following
the existing test pattern for a/ and b/ prefixes.

* Refactor git diff prefix tests to use parameterized loop

Consolidate 6 separate test methods
(testGetFullPathStripsLeading{A,B,I,W,C,O}Slash) into a
single parameterized test that loops over all git diff
prefixes. This follows the existing pattern used in
testGetFullPathStripsDelimiters and
testGetFullPathStripsTrailingPunctuation.

Benefits: - Reduces code duplication (from ~110 lines to ~20
lines) - Easier to maintain - adding new prefixes requires
one line instead of a full test method - Maintains test
coverage for all 6 git diff prefixes (a/, b/, i/, w/, c/,
o/) - Adds descriptive assertion messages showing which
prefix failed if a test fails 2026-01-31: Add repair button

parameters, eliminating kernel call overhead.

2026-01-23: Fix Kitty protocol a=T (transmit+display) with
identifier=0 (#566)

When using the Kitty graphics protocol with action=T
(transmit and display) without an explicit image ID, the
identifier defaults to 0. The image was correctly stored
under lastImageKey in transmissionDidFinish(), but the
lookup after transmission always used the identifier
directly, causing "ENOENT:Image not found after
transmission" errors.

This fix makes the lookup behavior consistent with storage:
use lastImageKey when identifier is 0, matching how
executeDisplayCommand already handles this case.

2026-01-21: Re-enable GCD timer on macOS 26 (#564)

The macOS 26 check that disabled GCD timer was added for
issue 12415, but the root cause was actually
NSAutoFillHeuristicController causing performance
degradation (see Ghostty PR 8625). That issue is already
addressed by disabling NSAutoFillHeuristicControllerEnabled.

Testing shows GCD timer achieves ~24fps while NSTimer only
achieves ~16fps at the 30fps cadence setting, due to
aggressive timer coalescing by macOS when no tolerance is
set. GCD timer's explicit 0.5ms tolerance prevents this
coalescing.

2026-01-21: Fix adaptive framerate always overriding
non-adaptive setting (#565)

A refactoring in 29b3a39d9 (April 2019) converted nested
if-else logic to early returns but missed adding a return
after the non-adaptive framerate path. This caused the
adaptive framerate code to always run and override the
cadence, even when useAdaptiveFrameRate was false.

The result was that disabling adaptive framerate had no
effect - users would still get the slow adaptive cadence
(15fps for non-Metal, 30fps for Metal) instead of the
configured active update cadence.

Cache bidi preference lookup using FAST_BOOL_ACCESSOR. Issue

Co-authored-by: George Nachman <gnachman@gmail.com>
2026-01-18: Cache margin preferences using FAST_INT_ACCESSOR
(#553)

* Cache margin preferences using FAST_INT_ACCESSOR

Add FAST_INT_ACCESSOR pattern to cache integer preferences
similar to existing FAST_BOOL_ACCESSOR. Apply to sideMargins
and topBottomMargins which are called 55 times per render
frame in the drawing hot path.

- Add iTermPreferencesIntCache struct - Add
FAST_INT_ACCESSOR macro - Add intWithCache: method - Add
sideMargins and topBottomMargins fast accessors - Update 29
call sites in iTermTextDrawingHelper.m - Update 26 call
sites in PTYTextView.m

* Use cached preference accessors in Metal renderers

Replace direct intForKey:/boolForKey: calls with fast cached
accessors (sideMargins, topBottomMargins,
maximizeThroughput) in Metal rendering code.

These preferences are read every frame at 60+ FPS. While the
per-call savings are modest, eliminating NSUserDefaults lock
acquisition reduces contention with other threads (main
thread, mutation queue) that also access preferences.

Files changed: - iTermMetalDriver.m: topBottomMargins,
maximizeThroughput - iTermMetalCellRenderer.m: sideMargins,
topBottomMargins - iTermMarkRenderer.m: sideMargins

* Cache session configuration preference lookups

Add FAST_BOOL_ACCESSOR for allowClipboardAccessFromTerminal
and dimOnlyText preferences, used in
updateConfigurationFields hot path.

These preferences are accessed every frame during rendering
and benefit from the same dispatch_once caching pattern used
for other hot-path preferences.
