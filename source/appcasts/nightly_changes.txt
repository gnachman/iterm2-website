button all the way to the edge of the window. Issue 9787

2021-06-27: Make extra space advanced pref work on windows
without visible window numbers.

Issue 8021

2021-06-27: Add iTerm2-shell-integration submodule. Update
copy_shell_integration.sh to pull from it.

I decided to keep a separate copy in the iTerm2 repo because
it needs a good bit of processing to be useful and I want to
keep the main repo dependency-free. Submodules already
require manual work to update, anyway, so the number of
steps remains the same.

2021-06-27: Assert that the foreground color is never set to
nil. Issue 9785

2021-06-27: [Python] Remove Splitter.__sessions

In the case of nested splitters, __sessions was not updated
when a child's sessions were changed. I think that
__sessions is an unnecessary optimization that adds a bunch
of complexity including this bug.

It manifested in issue 9784: changing a session's preferred
size had no effect. The reason is that the protobuf was
built by doing a DFS through __children but the tab.sessions
accessor uses __sessions which referred to different
objects.

While this change could affect user code I think the impact
will be limited to scripts affecting nested sessions. I
expect breakage will be on code that worked by accident.

2021-06-26: Make font configurable in text status bar
components. Issue 9782

change.

This wraps up issue 7943 (Switching profiles based on system
appearance)

WriteOnlyProfile (which was accidentally not exposed before)

2021-06-18: Replace profile.py with generated version

2021-06-18: Add gen_profile.py which generates profile.py to
make it easier to keep in sync.

Do `make iterm2/profile.py` to update it.

2021-06-17: Sort out presets and update default profile

2021-06-14: Add support for separate light/dark mode colors.
Still needs work: default profiles need to be updated,
Python API needs support, and wonky things happen when
switching between different profiles. Also sometimes the
editing popup button is not enabled when it should be.

2021-06-12: When you drag a top statusbar in a no-titlebar
window with a single tab and no split panes drag the window
instead of the tab. Issue 8123

problem introduced in commit
ee085065ada01f3968a96a96ce50b3f3c96a697e.

2021-06-05: Convert click coordinates to the adjusted
document visible rect before using them. This fixes a bug
where scrolling while there is new input coming + scrollback
overflow causes the selection to jump around. That's because
the click location is given to us by the OS based on where
the scrollview is scrolled to, but that doesn't exactly
correspond to what the user sees since we account for
scrollback overflow when drawing to keep the screen stable
when userScroll is on.

2021-06-05: When copying the server binary over, remove the
old one first.

2021-06-05: Fix a bug where the content jumps around when
scrolled up and there's scrollback overflow. Issue 9755

2021-06-03: Make opening tabs from the dashboard treat the

Also fix the appearance of selected rows in the window table
of the tmux dashboard. Issue 9746

2021-06-03: Don't send focus reports when password manager
is opening, open, or closing. Issue 9748

initialization
