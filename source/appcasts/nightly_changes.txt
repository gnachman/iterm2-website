2024-02-03: Avoid highlighting matches when the find

change was caused by another app. Issue 11302

2024-02-03: Show a warning if the open command fails when
secure keyboard entry is on

to end in a slash. Issue 11341

2024-01-31: Tolerate missing ~/.iterm2 folder when exporting
all settings. Issue 11336

2024-01-30: Use deferred side effects for flags changed (in
particular linefeed) and cursor-did-change-line notifs. This
lets us batch more related updates as seen in issue 11332 to
avoid redraws as inopportune times. The basic idea is to
handle more tokens in a batch with the hope of avoiding a
sync between DECRESET 25 and DECSET25.

2024-01-30: Fix browse button for picking custom Python API
scripts folder. Issue 11281

then pick Developer. Then pick any of the system colors.

alternate screen mode. Issue 11324

2024-01-28: Change how SCPFile dispatches to the main thread
because it ended up in a strange menu-related state
(according to the stack trace) where the mouse didn't work
right when interacting with modal alerts. I don't know why
this happened. This also fixes a data race where session was
accessed on the main thread. Issue 11322

it_appearanceForCurrentTheme that picked the default
