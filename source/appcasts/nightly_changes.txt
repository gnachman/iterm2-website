#480

the sessions in a multi-tab arrangement.

tabs when you haven't scrolled far enough yet.

2023-01-25: RFC: Report extra mouse buttons, issue 10689

This is a POC to add support for extra mouse buttons

left & right switching to different tabs collision * add
button 10 & 11

2023-01-06: Fix a bug where visible images got released if
there was scrollback overflow. I was using absolute line
numbers where I should have been using relative.

2023-01-03: Add iTermAtomicMutableArrayOfWeakObjects with
some sanity checking to figure out how the heck the call to
removeObjectsPassingTest: in -[LineBlock dealloc] is
throwing an exception that we're removing indexes past the
end of the array. The only way that could happen is a
synchronization bug. It looks airtight to me, but hopefully
the new assertions will turn something up.

Fix a bug when dropping part of a raw line. The LineBlock's
metadata caches the number of wrapped lines. When the
mutation thread drops excess lines, the metadata is updated
in the progenitor but that update was not reflected in its
clients. Later on a wrong cached value was used causing a
negative length in _wrappedLineWithWrapWidth and therefore a
negative length for a ScreenCharArray leading to a bad
memcpy when trying to pad the line.
