2026-01-06: Allow edge-attached windows to specify
width/height as cells or screen percentage

Edge-attached windows (top, bottom, left, right) can now
independently configure their width and height as either a
fixed number of cells or a percentage of the screen.
Previously only the spanning dimension could be a
percentage.

- Change iTermPercentage from double to struct with
width/height fields - Add separate units popups for rows and
columns in preferences - Add FrameCanonicalizer to
consolidate window frame calculations - Handle backward
compatibility for old arrangements/profiles

2025-12-28: Fix tab switch rendering glitch on multi-monitor
setups. Issue 11960

Call resizeDrawable() in draw() to ensure drawable size is
calculated with the current window's backing scale factor.
This fixes the case where the view was sized before being
added to a window, causing convertToBacking() to use the
main display's scale instead.

Also add a missing call to super.viewDidMoveToWindow.

2025-12-28: fix inline images foregroundcolor enum error
(#549)


2025-12-28: Show smart selection action URL on hover. While
doing that I noticed that if the interpolated string had a
side effect (such as opening a save panel) it would happen
multiple times including on hover. This change adds code to
track whether side-effects are allowed by an interpolated
string/function invocation. In cases where a side-effect is
undesired (e.g., showing the hover URL) the function call is
replaced with a placeholder.

2025-12-19: Tweak position and spacing of stoplight buttons
in minimal in macOS 26. I can't do what apple wants, which
is for the red button to be concentric with the window
radius, because then the title and shortcut label would be
weirdly high or weirdly unaligned since my tabbar is taller
than standard. Hopefully the departure of Alan Dye will fix
my problems because someone who uses computers can design
this stuff. Issue 12474

2025-12-01: Add .claude/*.local.json to gitignore (#544)

Local Claude Code settings should not be committed to
version control.  This allows developers to maintain
personal Claude Code preferences while keeping shared
configuration (like custom commands) in the repository.
2025-12-01: Add configurable new instance open style
preference (#537)

Introduce a new advanced setting 'newInstanceOpenStyle' to
control how new iTerm2 instances are opened when triggered
by scripts or external applications. This setting allows
users to specify whether new instances open in a new window,
new tab (default), vertical split pane, or horizontal split
pane, providing a more flexible and unified configuration.
Updated the application delegate to respect this setting
when opening files.
