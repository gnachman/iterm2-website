2025-03-08: When restoring a window arrangement, set the
frame and then canonicalize as the last step. In issue 12167
we see that restoring tabs, which may cause
makeKeyAndOrderFront: to be called, can change the window
frame to move it to an undesired screen! This attempts to
fix that problem by forcing the window back to its saved
frame (which ought to put it on the right screen) and then
canonicalizing the frame so it's valid for its window style.

2025-03-07: Fix bug where cursor goes offscreen in chat
input box

2025-03-07: Fix silent coprocesses with ssh integration. The
tty->coprocess communication didn't work because normally
TaskNotifier would append to the coprocess's output buffer
but that doesn't make sense when input is framed. When using
ssh integration, a different code path is taken now:
VT100Parser emits SSH_OUTPUT, TokenExecutor does not discard
it, and it makes its way to
VT100ScreenMutableState+TerminalDelegate, which sends it to
PTYSession to append to the coprocess's output buffer.
Similarly, simulated typing of data from from the coprocess
are now intercepted in -[PTYTask writeTask:coprocess] and
sent to PTYSession rather than just being written to the
task's file descriptor. Issue 12157
