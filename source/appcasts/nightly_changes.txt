2023-10-25: Try to fix issue 10712.

Banish auto layout from table view cells.  Fix minimum
height for tools Fix layout in job tool Collapse tools when
they don't fit to avoid constraint violations because auto
layout is maybe not completely avoidable

If anything in the window uses auto layout then autoresizing
*breaks* because the constraints that are supposed to
emulate auto layout simply don't work the same (for example,
hidden views constrain the movement of other views, which
can prevent the window from resizing). When the day comes
that I can no longer avoid auto layout I really don't know
what I'll do.
