2024-11-26: Don't crash if the path to ssh can't be found

2024-11-26: Fix a truly infuriating crash. If you try to use
Swift Process in a static property initializer, then Process
will spin an inner runloop, allowing it to become re-entrant
and crash. I know it's in poor taste to block the main loop
to run an executable, but sometimes you don't have a choice
and this is far worse than any reasonably forseeable
outcome. Replace the shiny Swift thing with an old and
busted Objective C thing that works sanely
