2023-05-04: When appending grid to linebuffer don't make the
last line partial even if it ends with the cursor. This was
changed for the benefit of filtering since it keeps a
linebuffer that it appends to after appending the grid, but
in all other use cases (like resizing) we want to preserve
the fidelity of the continuation mark on the last line of
the screen so when we pop it remains a hard EOL. This is
important for resizing because if it's soft then we add all
the nulls on the last line of the grid to the line buffer
and then pop them into a narrower window, causing a blank
line to be added at the bottom. To reproduce, add a few
screenfuls of text with ls and then narrow the window by one
column twice. Issue 10861

2023-05-04: Fix a bug where use nonascii font was ignored.
Issue 10860

2023-05-04: Support reentrant performBlockWithoutTriggers

2023-05-04: Fix an incorrect assumption that OSC 7 precedes
the prompt, when in fact it comes after. Also fix a
performance issue with PromptStateMachine - in Swift getting
the length of a string is an O(N) operation, it seems. This
caused performance problems when the state machine was
confused (e.g., start in tcsh with shell integration then
run zsh which sends OSC 7 and it gets stuck in the
'accruing' state). My dream is that some day I can enjoy the
quality of life I had in Turbo Pascal where counting the
length of a string could be done in constant time.
