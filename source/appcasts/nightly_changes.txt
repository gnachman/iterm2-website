2025-11-03: Fix a bunch of bugs related to full screen. The
window buttons were incorrectly shown/hidden when exiting
fullscreen. Sometimes the window title remained visible
after exiting. The tabbar height was wrong in compact.

2025-11-03: Change how stoplight buttons work on macOS 26.
Copying the buttons (using
standardWindowButton:forStyleMask:) is cursed - I have no
idea why this API exists if it doesn't produce a usable
button, but whatever - so instead we do more or less what
Chrome has done and only use the "real" buttons but hide
them or fade them in and out as needed. This fixes a bug
where buttons did the wrong thing on hover, and hopefully
fixes a bug where they'd flicker sometimes. We do still have
the ability to tweak the vertical position of the buttons
with the private _titleHeight override. Issue 12474

2025-10-09: Fix missing rowID assertion failures in graph
database recovery

The graph database would fail with missing rowID assertions
when save operations failed and left in-memory records in a
corrupted state. Recovery now creates a fresh encoder with
no previous revision, treating all records as inserts rather
than updates/deletes, which avoids the need for valid rowIDs
in the "before" state. On recovery failure, self.record is
now cleared to prevent corrupted state from propagating to
subsequent save attempts.

Additional fixes: - Create fresh FMDatabase instance during
recovery to avoid corrupted cached state - Fix PRAGMA
queries to use executeQuery instead of executeUpdate,
cleaning up
  result sets.
- Improve error propagation in delta encoder to halt on
first error - Fix transaction rollback to always return NO
when block fails to properly
  propagate failures.

2025-10-02: Reset overflow when doing a mutation
thread-initiated sync because the subsequent call to
refreshAfterSync: will adjust the scrollview for scrollback
overflow when there is userscroll so it stays locked to the
same location. If we do not reset overflow, then that
overflow will be applied doubly, causing the scroll position
to drift upwards. See email with subject line 'Change in
Scroll Behavior During Continuous Output'
