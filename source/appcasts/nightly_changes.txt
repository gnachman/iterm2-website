2022-02-05: Update shell integration

2022-02-05: Fix incorrect use of mutableState from main
thread in search. Invalidate tail find timer when dirty
cells are found. This fixes a bug where two -refresh calls
in the same spin of the runloop broke tail find (because it
thought it was still finding so it declined to search even
though some search results were removed).

2022-02-04: Fix selecting menu items in pointer action

2022-02-04: Downgrade todo to comment

2022-02-04: Enable thread sanitizer

2022-02-04: Remove resolved TODO

2022-02-04: Fix leak of AATree

2022-02-04: Fix a bug where hidden annotations would briefly
flash visible

2022-02-04: Remove already-addressed todo

2022-02-04: Remove already-addressed TODOs

2022-02-04: Nil out interval tree object entries when
removing all. I think this caused the assertion I kept
hitting when adding an object back later (the doppelganger
had a nonnil entry)

2022-02-04: Remove already-addressed todos

2022-02-04: Remove already-addressed TODO

2022-02-04: Add missing delegate methods

2022-02-03: Allow requesting Bluetooth permission (#457)

Add NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription.  Command line
applications that use CoreBluetooth will crash with SIGABRT
if this is not present in info.plist.  2022-02-03: Reduce
calls to screenDidReceiveLineFeed

2022-02-03: Resolve TODO

2022-02-03: Remove todo. I already moved
removeInaccessibleIntervalTreeObjects to didSynchronize

2022-02-03: Remove some TODOs. We are already limiting
temporaryDoubleBuffer.drawSavedGrid=YES and haveScrolled=NO
to when resetting scrollback overflow, which weakly relates
to when draws happen. I think it's good enough but real
world experience will tell for sure. I also don't think
there's any reason to update the grid's currentDate in
didSynchronize because it's set prior to executing a vector
of tokens and I don't see anywhere that we mark dirty just
after synchronizing.

2022-02-03: Use absolute ranges when computing intervals.
This behaves better when intervals are before the start of
history. Remove inaccessible interval tree objects at the
end of sync. After syncing, run any pending side-effects.

2022-02-03: Add VT100GridAbsCoordRangeContainsAbsCoord

2022-02-02: Add debug logs

2022-02-02: Fix typo

2022-02-02: Hold the lineblock mutex during mutations. There
was a race between cowCopy nilling the mutation certificate
and willModify allocating it. Not to mention writing to
memory is unsafe while copying it.

2022-02-02: Document why trigger checks should be done just
before sync

2022-02-02: Address TODO

2022-02-02: Pass dimmingAmount through screen config. Remove
some todos

2022-02-02: Fix some warnings

2022-02-02: Actually you don't need to pause to send a
report because all reports are sent through a side-effect.

2022-02-02: Finish auditing side effects for runloops.
Dispatch async as needed. Also caught a few places that
needed to be paused.

2022-02-02: Avoid calling screenDidAddMark if not alerting.

Use the mark's doppelganger in
screenDidUpdateReturnCodeForMark:remoteHost: and
screenCommandDidExitWithCode:mark:

Prevent tmux tokens from having runloops in side effects.

Use a joined side effect for screenDidAddNote:focus: because
it will call -refresh.

2022-02-01: Remove NSLog

2022-02-01: Speed up querying for terminfo values. Fix
colors, Co, and RGB.

2022-01-31: Ensure that we never join from a non-paused
side-effect.

2022-01-30: Remove more join from side effects

2022-01-30: Remove incorrect assertions. You can't run code
in this class from a side-effect.

2022-01-30: Outlaw joining from side-effects to avoid
out-of-order side-effects.

Fix a bug where grids didn't get merged if udpateDirty ran
while state is shared between mutable&immutable.

2022-01-29: remove debug code

2022-01-29: While the main and mutation threads are joined,
keep VT100Screen.state exactly equal to
VT100Screen.mutableState. A bit of NSProxy magic ensures
that only interval tree doppelgangers are accessible through
.state and that iTermColorMap's delegate remains the mutable
state in state.colorMap.delegate. Clean up various other
odds and ends

2022-01-29: Pass resetOverflow to didSynchronize so it is
always called

2022-01-29: Oops, missed one line in the last commit

2022-01-29: Add some todos, add missing return

2022-01-27: Remove todo

2022-01-27: Delete PPC code

2022-01-27: When you do ED 2 (CSI 2 J) in alternate screen
when visible marks are present and the screen is empty (or
marks occur below the last non-empty line), scroll the marks
off the screen.

2022-01-27: Avoid updating untouched parts of the config

2022-01-27: Clean up some todos. Reuse triggers when
reloading profile when possible

2022-01-27: Create a general method for idempotent side
effects and use it for setNeedsRedraw and
intervalTreeVisibleRangeDidChange

2022-01-27: Remove todo, make needsRedraw nonatomic

2022-01-27: Remove todo

2022-01-27: Remove todos, don't try to handle token
injection on arbitrary queues

2022-01-27: Remove todos

2022-01-27: Make copying a temporary double buffer cheap
when it hasn't changed.

2022-01-27: Mark grid dirty when restoring

2022-01-27: Move animatedLines to VT100Screen to make
updating VT100ScreenState cheaper

2022-01-27: Make the mark cache track whether it's dirty so
syncing is cheap when it's unchanged

2022-01-27: Remove some todos that have been todone

2022-01-26: Remove dead code

2022-01-26: Avoid copying the colormap on sync. Instead,
mirror changes to the mutable colormap in the immutable one
in side-effects like we do for the interval tree. Refactor
some color-setting code to make it faster. Also fix a hang
on launch when concurrency is disabled.

2022-01-26: Use addPausedSideEffect in
VT100ScreenMutableState+TerminalDelegate

2022-01-26: Prevent reentrant setConfig:

Sync before and after nested joined side effects so that
changes to the colormap are reflected in the delegate's
copy.

Make setMutingAmount and setDimOnlyText be side-effect-free
when no change is made to avoid infinite recursion in
setConfig:.

2022-01-26: Fixes and performance improvements

Move throughput estimation to mutation thread.

Don't use AsciiData asynchronously: that's a USF. Intead,
make a copy before dispatching if logging is needed.

Change how updates from the mutation thread to the main
thread (for the purposes of changing cadence, setting
active, etc.) works. Bundle up info into
VT100ScreenTokenExecutorUpdate and send updates periodically
while input is being handled. The delegate interface in
TokenExecutor for these is also simplified to a single call.

Add maybeHasExpectations to iTermExpect since getting the
array of expectations is slow.

Add low-priority side-effects. They get quued to run but do
not cause an immediate dispatch to the main queue every
time. It uses a PeriodicScheduler to ensure they are
dispatched within 33 ms. This greatly improves performance.

Add PeriodicScheduler to help coalesce repeated operations.
This is similar to iTermRateLimitedUpdate but is quite a bit
simpler and works off the main thread.

Reduce calls to [NSDate date] during mutation since it is
slow.

Add various small optimizations to VT100Grid.

Coalesce calls to intervalTreeVisibleRangeDidChange.

Make performingJoinedBlock a class property to avoid
deadlock when performJoinedBlock is reentrant with two
different screens, as when detaching from tmux.

Avoid mutating nil interval tree objects. I am sad that
despite nullability annotations the compiler can't catch
this.

Avoid checking if termType contains screen on every token
because doing so is slow.

2022-01-25: Performance improvements

2022-01-25: Avoid calling logging side-effects or creating
strings while appending ascii data if they are not needed.

2022-01-25: Avoid repeatedly doing a slow check for CPU type

2022-01-25: Fix assert on launch

2022-01-25: Make trigger delegate callsbacks go through
TokenExecutor's scheduler when async to avoid unpausable
work accruing on the mutation queue.

Fix a data race - intervals were shared between the mutable
and derivative interval trees.

Improve MutableAtomicObject by adding a set method.

Prevent re-entrant side effects. I noticed you could get two
alerts from alert triggers at the same time because the
runloop allows events (which could kick off high-pri tasks,
which could themselves have side-effects) to run while the
main queue is blocked. This means side effects could
potentially run long after syncing state. Keep an eye out
for problems with this.

2022-01-25: Enable concurrent VT100ScreenState use/mutation
by advanced pref. Fix various data races and add assertions.

2022-01-25: Make triggers run deletate methods on the right
queue

2022-01-25: Port more of ScreenChar to Swift

2022-01-25: Port more of ScreenChar to Swift

2022-01-25: Move screenchar logic for complex strings into a
new class that allows concurrent access

2022-01-25: Make iTermImageInfoReading to isolate the
mutation points. The class was already designed to be used
concurrently, so this is just sugar.

2022-01-25: Move iTermTokenExecutorDelegate to
VT100ScreenMutableState

2022-01-25: Big cleanup.

* ARCify VT100WorkingDirectory, iTermImageInfo, iTermMark.
* Move code->iTermImageInfo map into a new class,
ImageRegistery.  * Make various classes immutable
(VT100RemoteHost, VT100WorkingDirectory,
iTermCapturedOutputMark, iTermImageMark) * Make LineBlock's
observers an ObjC array because it's impossible to reason
about object lifetimes in C++ data structures.  * Fix a leak
of metadata line copied line blocks.  * Fix use after
dealloc of _shell when replacing a terminated session.  *
Fix leak of VT100ScreenState in sync.  * Don't register
VT100ScreenMark doppelgangers.  * Fix oob write when
changing cusor type while it's in the overflow column * Fix
a race that made restoring images not always work (garbage
collected prematurely)

2022-01-25: Sure PTYTextView's colormap is up to date. Fix
various mis-uses of the interval tree and clean up the code,
renaming it to EventuallyConsistentIntervalTree.

2022-01-25: Checkpoint - everything is broken

2022-01-25: Move IntervalTree.h in project to be with its .m

2022-01-25: Delete dead code

2022-01-25: Move destructivelySetScreenWidth

2022-01-25: remove needless mutation wrapper

2022-01-25: Revert "Move destructivelySetScreenWidth, remove
silly setMayHaveDoubleWidthCharacters wrapper"

This reverts commit
11c06608b4a307d964ed92409f3bd3ed3105a3d9.

2022-01-25: Fix a bug where horizontal cursor movement
didn't cause a redraw.

Fix a bug where the 'reduce flicker' setting was ignored.

Improve the API for double buffering and make it work again.

Fix a bug where tokenExecutorDidHandleInput was called if
there were side-effects but no tokens handled.

Make VT100ScreenState the double-buffer's delegate instead
of VT100Screen.

Tell VT100ScreenState what queue it should be used on so it
can tell the double buffer where to run its timer.

Extend iTermGCDTimer to accept a queue.

2022-01-25: Remove mutSetWorkingDirectory

2022-01-25: Remove mutAddNoteWithText:inAbsoluteRnage:

2022-01-25: Add mutateAsynchronously to modify
VT100ScreenMutableState but without blocking until it's done
with its current token. Use it for command-end inference
(useful with trigger-detected prompts).

2022-01-25: Remove dead code

2022-01-25: Remove VT100Screen.terminal. Hurray!!!

2022-01-25: Make sgrCodesForCharacter a class method

2022-01-25: Add terminal state dictionary to
VT100ScreenState so that encoding restoration state doesn't
require using terminal directly. This might be slow.

2022-01-25: Make encoding screen contents use joined threads
to avoid accessing the terminal directly

2022-01-25: Add terminalCharset

2022-01-25: remove terminal from PTYTextView0DataSource

2022-01-25: Use _screen.terminalBracketedPasteMode

2022-01-25: Remove dead code. Goodbye PTYSession.terminal!

2022-01-25: Make resetCharset use joined threads

2022-01-25: Make applescript get answerback string from
profile, not terminal

2022-01-25: Fix return type of
tryToFinishAttachingToMultiserverWithPartialAttachment.

Begin tmux recovery mode in the parser before registering
with tasknotifier so input can be handled correctly as soon
as it arrives. If the session won't actually be a tmux
gateway because we failed to attach to a runnign server,
cancel tmux recovery mode right away.

Pause the token executor before enabling the terminal so
initial setup can complete before the first token is
executed.

Fix a bug in how VT100TmuxParser ignored its first line of
input in recovery mode.

2022-01-25: Use joined threads to reset send modifiers when
restoring an session not attached to a server

2022-01-25: Make naggingControllerDisableBracketedPasteMode

2022-01-25: Fix a missed terminalBracketedPasteMode

2022-01-25: Fix a bug where Always and Never didn't work in
the annoucement for paste bracketing oopsies

2022-01-25: Add terminalBracketedPasteMode

2022-01-25: Make tmuxHostDisconnected go through a joined
thread. I removed the dispatch to the tmux queue because
joining the parsing queue is simpler and should be just as
safe. The only risk is that it somehow gets ordered before
some writes on the tmux queue, but I don't think it'll be a
problem because those clients get shut down and the writes
will just fail with a broken pipe.

2022-01-25: Move setTmuxMode into joined thread. Disable
focus reporting for tmux gateway

2022-01-25: Use terminalReportFocus instead of
terminal.reportFocus

2022-01-25: Make terminalFileShouldStop use terminal in a

Proxy colormap delegate through VT100ScreenMutableState and
make PTYSession's delegate calls take an immutable colormap
and run as a side-effect

2022-01-25: Expose VT100Terminal's state through VT100Screen

2022-01-25: Move terminalSetIconTitle to
VT100ScreenMutableState

VT100ScreenMutableState

2022-01-25: Move the rest of printing code to
VT100ScreenMutableState

2022-01-25: Move terminalRemoveTabStopAtCursor to
VT100ScreenMutableState

2022-01-25: Update terminal-originated resizing and all
resetting to be parallelizable. To accomplish this we
introduce joining, where the main thread and mutation thread

This reverts commit
76b3bf7efb74e22a233f910700de1bbc8c59caab.

2022-01-25: Move terminalShouldREportVariable to
VT100ScreenMutableState

2022-01-25: Move terminalShouldSendReport to
VT100ScreenMutableState

2022-01-25: Move terminalMoveCursorToX:y: to

2022-01-25: Move trigger evaluation into
VT100ScreenMutableState

2022-01-25: Pause token execution for invoke trigger and
evaluating interpolated strings

2022-01-25: Make VT100ScreenMutableState implement
triggerSession methods

2022-01-25: Move ownership of token executor to
VT100ScreenMutableState. Make changing remotehost pause
token execution so APS has a chance to run before any more
tokens are parsed.

2022-01-25: Refactor token execution into TokenExecutor. It
adds 'pausing' as a feature, which lets the mutation queue
stop handling new tokens until a trigger's side effects are
complete. For example, when the remote host changes we want
automatic profile switching to run before handling the next
token (which might cause different triggers to run if the
profile changes)

2022-01-25: Eliminate Trigger from CapturedOutput. Serialize
its command as a string. This does break state restoration
for captured output commands, unfortunately.

2022-01-25: Make VT100ScreenMutableState conform to
iTermTriggerScopeProvider

2022-01-25: Make VT100ScreenMutableState conform to
iTermTriggerSession. For now it's just an adapter to
PTYSession where the real impl is.

2022-01-25: PTYTriggerEvaluatorDataSource shouldn't derived
form PTYTextViewDataSource because it's freaking huge.
Define a narrowly tailored protocol instead.

2022-01-25: Move -PTYTriggerEvaluatorDelegate to
VT100ScreenMutableState

2022-01-25: Split out

2022-01-25: Move softAlternateScreenModeDidChange to
VT100ScreenMutableState

encodes refcounts to use secure coding properly

2022-01-25: Indentation fix

2022-01-25: Make lastRemoteHost a protocol

2022-01-25: Move some code around to match move_triggers
branch

2022-01-25: Fix call to screenCurrentHostDidChange on
restoration to occur after interval tree deserialization. It
was done weirdly early for a reason that is no longer valid
- that you'd get a warning about mouse reporting being left
on. That is not a problem because the previous remote host
is nil.

2022-01-25: Move code to set remote host into
VT100ScreenMutableState.

2022-01-25: Remove dead code

2022-01-25: Fix wrong directory used when fetching working
directory after getting an empty path (although I doubt this
code is actually reached in production - I had to use a
weird OSC 7 url to reproduce it)

2022-01-25: Move code to set the current working directory
into VT100ScreenMutableState

since rate limits must be used only on the main thread.

2022-01-25: Simplify triggerSession methods for captured
output announcement

2022-01-25: Update annotation trigger's delegate API to
split creating the annotation (which can be done on the
mutation thread) from setting its value (which must be done
on the main thread).

2022-01-25: Move alert-showing logic into
iTermTriggerSession method

2022-01-25: Expose iTermPromise.hasValue

2022-01-25: Use scope provider interface in triggers. This
will be useful when we have to switch threads to access
scope.

2022-01-25: Make iTermExpectation possible to use in a world
with a mutation thread. The mutation thread will use a copy
and reflect changes back to the main thread.

2022-01-25: Make trigger parameter resolution use a promise
instead of a completion block

2022-01-25: Get rid of unsafe array of strings in trigger's
performAction method

2022-01-25: Various improvements to iTermPromise: make it
thread-safe, implement -isEqual: and -hash:, assert that
notification happens at most once, assert seals are
fullfilled/rejected before dealloc, add -hasValue, make the
seal retain the promise.

2022-01-25: Move commandRange into VT100ScreenMutableState
and call screenCommandDidChangeWithRange asynchronously

cumulativeScrollbackOverflow in mutation paths

2022-01-25: Move removeAnnotation to VT100ScreenMutableState

2022-01-25: Make removing an interval tree object's observer
call a side effect. Fix a bug where it wasn't actually
removed from the minimap because the entry got nilled before
use (yikes)

2022-01-25: Move setNeedsRedraw to VT100ScreenMutableState

2022-01-25: Make it possible to call interval tree observer
methods as a side-effect.

2022-01-25: Move the 1-arg version of
intervalForGridCoordRange to VT100ScreenState

2022-01-25: Move intervalForGridCoordRange:width:linesOffset

2022-01-25: Move appendLineFeed to VT100ScreenMutableState

2022-01-25: Make removing the selection upon scrolling in
alternate screen mode when not appending to history into a
side-effect

2022-01-25: Refactor side effect performing into
VT100ScreenMutableState so it can call it directly

2022-01-25: Eliminate -mutableCurrentGrid

2022-01-25: Make calls to self.cursorX go through
VT100ScreenState

2022-01-25: Make calls to cursorY go through
VT100ScreenState

2022-01-25: Make VT100Screen and its categories access
cumulativeScrollbackOverflow from the correct state variable
instead of self.totalScrollbackOverflow

2022-01-25: Move numberOfScrollbackLines to VT100ScreenState

2022-01-25: Move incrementOverflowBy: to

file

2022-01-25: Refactor VT100ScreenState to begin moving logic
