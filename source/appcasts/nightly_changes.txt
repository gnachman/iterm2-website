2025-10-02: Fix opening terminal sessions by URL. Issue
12511

2025-10-02: Reset overflow when doing a mutation
thread-initiated sync because the subsequent call to
refreshAfterSync: will adjust the scrollview for scrollback
overflow when there is userscroll so it stays locked to the
same location. If we do not reset overflow, then that
overflow will be applied doubly, causing the scroll position
to drift upwards. See email with subject line 'Change in
Scroll Behavior During Continuous Output'

2025-10-01: Make cmd-shift-click on url open it in a split
pane.

2025-10-01: Don't crash in clear to selection when the
absolute line numbers are out of range. I'm not sure why,
could be arithmetic overflow

2025-10-01: Don't assert if a session can't be revived. It
will leave things in a bad state but it's better than
crashing

reentrant if the window is not loaded

the current profile's type

2025-10-01: Prevent coordForPoint:allowRightMarginOverflow:
from returning negative values, which can cause a crash

2025-10-01: Fix excess file descriptor closing crash due to
password manager. The root cause was that DispatchIO wants
to own the file descriptor but the passed-in Pipes also own
them.

2025-09-30: Detect when shell echos a control character
meant to clear the current prompt and backspace over it when
opening composer. Issue 12510. Adjust how the trigger
evaluator squelches periodic evaluation to handle
short-lived expectations.

2025-09-29: Fix scoring of menu item results in open
quickly. Documents scores are relative to their position in
the list and the tooltip should come first because it is
lower precision. Also reduce the multiplier for menu item
scoring because it's better to get real items for
arrangements,  profiles, and bookmarks than the menu item
equivalents for those things. Inspired by issue 12499

2025-09-29: Bring arrangements back to open quickly. Issue
12499

2025-09-29: Bring back 'Fix lookups of profile row and
columns that don't fall back to default values', originally
in commit 7829c74d5ed2990654fab63e3bfbe06395107d68, which
was reverted by commit
e70e2d2a880fe6d07c23b87d742b299f14d3e8e4. The actual problem
was mixing up rows and columns in
iTermAdjustFontSizeHelper.m. See the comment here:

2025-09-26: Turn on NSTimer-based cadence by default for
macOS 26 for issue 12415. This risks a reprise of the
problem fixed by 4d0ab1ec751472faca824c534cca3d31dba916d6,
but since GCD is getting starved and the NSTimer might not
(and the use of GCD to kick off token execution is no longer
relevant), it seems like a good idea.

2025-09-19: Fix auto layout hell when adding a browser split
pane which prevented the window from becoming narrower. I
don't know why this fix works but I'm grateful for it
nonethe less. I did try literally everything else: making
all the auto resizing masks [.width,.height], setting
.translatesAutoResizingMaskToConstraints=false on
everything, and even hackily removing constraints. None of
this did a damn thing. NSSplitView turns on
translatesAutoResizingMaskToConstraints on its views and
also changes their autoresizing masks to
[.maxWidth,.maxHeight]. I tried hacking around that but that
didn't work either. I also tried interposing a view that
uses auto layout intentionally to allow arbitrary resizing
but that still had no effect. It seems like the bad
autoresizing mask->constraint translation happens instantly
everywhere, so things like the window title constrain the
window's size because the translation is done more or less
incompetently. I still do not understand why it constrained
the window's minimum width but not its maximum. As far as I
can tell it is impossible to analyze in any meaningful way.
With as much sincerity as I can muster, fuck auto layout.

This reverts commit
cbb072bb80a07b1ab9794a1ac421dd87b8012c18.

I'm reverting this because NSGlassEffectView uses auto
layout and there doesn't seem to be any way to prevent it.
This posions the whole window, preventing you from resizing
it and spewing errors about conflicting constraints.

The ominous prophecy in commit
c587890d84c11bf5bc20d2160a5c99401bd383d3 rears its head.

2025-09-02: Make 'remember frames' a first class citizen for
issue 12395

2025-09-02: Remove some incomprehensible logic that dates
back to 2009 (commit ed38bb49b in the old-iterm repo) that
tweaked the Y origin of windows whose frames were saved by
the difference in height between the default frame and then
restored frame. That code was ported over but I never
understood the rationale, and after staring at it for a
while I still don't understand it. Perhaps it was to hack
around some bug in an earlyish version of macOS? If you're
gonna save frames, you should restore them as they were
saved is the new rationale, so at least there is one now.
This was inspired by issue 12395 but it doesn't fix their
problem, which is that auto frame restoration surprisingly
causes the desired size in the profile to be ignored
sometimes. I have never loved auto frame restoration for
this reason but I am reluctant to eliminate it because I'm
sure some people expect it to continue working as it always
has.
