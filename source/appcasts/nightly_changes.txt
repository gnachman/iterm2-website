2025-10-09: Fix missing rowID assertion failures in graph
database recovery

The graph database would fail with missing rowID assertions
when save operations failed and left in-memory records in a
corrupted state. Recovery now creates a fresh encoder with
no previous revision, treating all records as inserts rather
than updates/deletes, which avoids the need for valid rowIDs
in the "before" state. On recovery failure, self.record is
now cleared to prevent corrupted state from propagating to
subsequent save attempts.

Additional fixes: - Create fresh FMDatabase instance during
recovery to avoid corrupted cached state - Fix PRAGMA
queries to use executeQuery instead of executeUpdate,
cleaning up
  result sets.
- Improve error propagation in delta encoder to halt on
first error - Fix transaction rollback to always return NO
when block fails to properly
  propagate failures.

2025-10-02: Reset overflow when doing a mutation
thread-initiated sync because the subsequent call to
refreshAfterSync: will adjust the scrollview for scrollback

to drift upwards. See email with subject line 'Change in

2025-09-29: Fix scoring of menu item results in open
quickly. Documents scores are relative to their position in
the list and the tooltip should come first because it is
lower precision. Also reduce the multiplier for menu item
scoring because it's better to get real items for

equivalents for those things. Inspired by issue 12499

2025-09-19: Fix auto layout hell when adding a browser split
pane which prevented the window from becoming narrower. I
don't know why this fix works but I'm grateful for it
nonethe less. I did try literally everything else: making
all the auto resizing masks [.width,.height], setting
.translatesAutoResizingMaskToConstraints=false on
everything, and even hackily removing constraints. None of
this did a damn thing. NSSplitView turns on
translatesAutoResizingMaskToConstraints on its views and
also changes their autoresizing masks to
[.maxWidth,.maxHeight]. I tried hacking around that but that
didn't work either. I also tried interposing a view that
uses auto layout intentionally to allow arbitrary resizing
but that still had no effect. It seems like the bad
autoresizing mask->constraint translation happens instantly
everywhere, so things like the window title constrain the
window's size because the translation is done more or less
incompetently. I still do not understand why it constrained
the window's minimum width but not its maximum. As far as I
can tell it is impossible to analyze in any meaningful way.
With as much sincerity as I can muster, fuck auto layout.

2025-09-09: Revert "Use whizzy liquid glass for find panel"

This reverts commit
cbb072bb80a07b1ab9794a1ac421dd87b8012c18.

I'm reverting this because NSGlassEffectView uses auto
layout and there doesn't seem to be any way to prevent it.
This posions the whole window, preventing you from resizing
it and spewing errors about conflicting constraints.

The ominous prophecy in commit
c587890d84c11bf5bc20d2160a5c99401bd383d3 rears its head.

2025-09-02: Make 'remember frames' a first class citizen for
issue 12395

2025-09-02: Remove some incomprehensible logic that dates
back to 2009 (commit ed38bb49b in the old-iterm repo) that
tweaked the Y origin of windows whose frames were saved by
the difference in height between the default frame and then
restored frame. That code was ported over but I never
understood the rationale, and after staring at it for a
while I still don't understand it. Perhaps it was to hack
around some bug in an earlyish version of macOS? If you're
gonna save frames, you should restore them as they were
saved is the new rationale, so at least there is one now.
This was inspired by issue 12395 but it doesn't fix their
problem, which is that auto frame restoration surprisingly
causes the desired size in the profile to be ignored
sometimes. I have never loved auto frame restoration for
this reason but I am reluctant to eliminate it because I'm
sure some people expect it to continue working as it always
has.
