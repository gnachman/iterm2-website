2026-01-23: Fix Kitty protocol a=T (transmit+display) with
identifier=0 (#566)

When using the Kitty graphics protocol with action=T
(transmit and display) without an explicit image ID, the
identifier defaults to 0. The image was correctly stored
under lastImageKey in transmissionDidFinish(), but the
lookup after transmission always used the identifier
directly, causing "ENOENT:Image not found after
transmission" errors.

This fix makes the lookup behavior consistent with storage:
use lastImageKey when identifier is 0, matching how
executeDisplayCommand already handles this case.

- Move gPerformingJoinedBlock from VT100ScreenMutableState.m
to iTermGCD.m - Add comprehensive documentation explaining
coordination signals:
  - Join context (joined, performingJoinedBlock) - Queue
  safety markers (for assertions) - Related state in
  TokenExecutor (pauseCount, executingSideEffects, etc.)
- Preserve atomic exchange semantics for
setPerformingJoinedBlock: - Add forwarding accessors in
VT100ScreenMutableState for compatibility

2026-01-21: Re-enable GCD timer on macOS 26 (#564)

The macOS 26 check that disabled GCD timer was added for
issue 12415, but the root cause was actually
NSAutoFillHeuristicController causing performance
degradation (see Ghostty PR 8625). That issue is already
addressed by disabling NSAutoFillHeuristicControllerEnabled.

Testing shows GCD timer achieves ~24fps while NSTimer only
achieves ~16fps at the 30fps cadence setting, due to
aggressive timer coalescing by macOS when no tolerance is
set. GCD timer's explicit 0.5ms tolerance prevents this
coalescing.

2026-01-21: Fix adaptive framerate always overriding
non-adaptive setting (#565)

A refactoring in 29b3a39d9 (April 2019) converted nested
if-else logic to early returns but missed adding a return
after the non-adaptive framerate path. This caused the
adaptive framerate code to always run and override the
cadence, even when useAdaptiveFrameRate was false.

The result was that disabling adaptive framerate had no
effect - users would still get the slow adaptive cadence
(15fps for non-Metal, 30fps for Metal) instead of the
configured active update cadence.

2026-01-18: Cache margin preferences using FAST_INT_ACCESSOR
(#553)

* Cache margin preferences using FAST_INT_ACCESSOR

Add FAST_INT_ACCESSOR pattern to cache integer preferences
similar to existing FAST_BOOL_ACCESSOR. Apply to sideMargins
and topBottomMargins which are called 55 times per render
frame in the drawing hot path.

- Add iTermPreferencesIntCache struct - Add
FAST_INT_ACCESSOR macro - Add intWithCache: method - Add
sideMargins and topBottomMargins fast accessors - Update 29
call sites in iTermTextDrawingHelper.m - Update 26 call
sites in PTYTextView.m

* Use cached preference accessors in Metal renderers

Replace direct intForKey:/boolForKey: calls with fast cached
accessors (sideMargins, topBottomMargins,
maximizeThroughput) in Metal rendering code.

These preferences are read every frame at 60+ FPS. While the
per-call savings are modest, eliminating NSUserDefaults lock
acquisition reduces contention with other threads (main
thread, mutation queue) that also access preferences.

Files changed: - iTermMetalDriver.m: topBottomMargins,
maximizeThroughput - iTermMetalCellRenderer.m: sideMargins,
topBottomMargins - iTermMarkRenderer.m: sideMargins

* Cache session configuration preference lookups

Add FAST_BOOL_ACCESSOR for allowClipboardAccessFromTerminal
and dimOnlyText preferences, used in
updateConfigurationFields hot path.

These preferences are accessed every frame during rendering
and benefit from the same dispatch_once caching pattern used
for other hot-path preferences.

2026-01-06: Allow edge-attached windows to specify

Edge-attached windows (top, bottom, left, right) can now
independently configure their width and height as either a
fixed number of cells or a percentage of the screen.
Previously only the spanning dimension could be a
percentage.

- Change iTermPercentage from double to struct with

columns in preferences - Add FrameCanonicalizer to

main display's scale instead.

Also add a missing call to super.viewDidMoveToWindow.

undesired (e.g., showing the hover URL) the function call is
replaced with a placeholder.

2025-12-01: Add configurable new instance open style

Introduce a new advanced setting 'newInstanceOpenStyle' to
control how new iTerm2 instances are opened when triggered
by scripts or external applications. This setting allows
users to specify whether new instances open in a new window,
new tab (default), vertical split pane, or horizontal split
pane, providing a more flexible and unified configuration.
Updated the application delegate to respect this setting
when opening files.
