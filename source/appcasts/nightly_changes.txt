2024-09-06: Fix vertical alignment of box-drawing characters
in the presence of vertical spacing. I think the problem was
that the text renderer centers glyphs within their
cell-including-spacing, which requires shifting glyphs by
half the height of the extra spacing but that logic was not
properly replicated in iTermCharacterSource. This commit
carefully ensures we draw the glyph in exactly the rect that
the text renderer expects it to be in. Issue 11478

2024-09-06: In modifyOtherKeys mode 1, option-return should
send esc-return. This pleases emacs. I don't think xterm

it's just the wild west here. Issue 11833

contents. Issue 10551

2024-09-04: When saving a window arrangement with all
windows, sort window controllers by window number (the
shortcut number) so they'll have the same partial order when
restored. Issue 11813

2024-09-04: Don't assume VS16 has to be immediately after
