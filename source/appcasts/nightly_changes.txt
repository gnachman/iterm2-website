2024-09-06: Fix vertical alignment of box-drawing characters
in the presence of vertical spacing. I think the problem was
that the text renderer centers glyphs within their
cell-including-spacing, which requires shifting glyphs by
half the height of the extra spacing but that logic was not
properly replicated in iTermCharacterSource. This commit
carefully ensures we draw the glyph in exactly the rect that
the text renderer expects it to be in. Issue 11478
