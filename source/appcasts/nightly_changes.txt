2020-05-28: Change how tmux integration output is routed.
Rather than calling threadedReadTask: from the tmuxQueue,
write to a pipe from tmuxQueue. The read end of the pipe is
like any other session in TaskNotifier, except that it
doesn't accept writes. This provides backpressure so that we
don't buffer too much data from tmux. That won't make a
difference to tmux 3.1 but will in 3.2 when the work in
https://github.com/tmux/tmux/issues/2217 lands.

2020-05-27: When youg get %window-pane-changed for a pane
that doesn't exist yet, activate the pane if it's in the

do  and the new pane will magically have keyboard focus.

CSI > Pm n to reset the setting. See
https://github.com/mintty/mintty/issues/881#issuecomment-629601970

2020-05-16: In CSI u mode send esc+{ for meta+shift+[ on a
US keyboard. A careful reading of the spec indicates that
you should behave like a legacy terminal for
meta+shift+key-that-produces-unicode-characters. nicm
pointed out the behavior in
https://github.com/mintty/mintty/issues/881#issuecomment-629594864

2020-05-16: Ignore dock-only changes to screen parameters

2020-05-15: Fix a bug where the dock would appear over a
nonnative fullscreen window because we aren't able to tell
which screen has the dock when our presentation options
cause the dock to be hidden; consequently, we believed the
dock was not on the same screen as a fullscren window, and
we changed the presentation option back to show it. The hack
used herein is to remember the last screen that had the dock
and assume it hasn't moved. That ought to mostly work,
unless the user does something devious like move the dock to
another screen where it is also not visible.

misusing it, but if I had a nickel for every time c++
shivved me in the back I'd still hate the sob

2020-05-05: Suppress short-lived session warning if closing
because of detach

2020-05-04: Fix crash where a divorced session had a profile
whose GUID was in shared, not sessions ProfileModel.

The repro steps are: 1. Create a new window 2. Cmd-+ to
increase font size 3. Split vertically 4. Edit font in
shared profile to make it smaller 5. Cmd-+ in the new
session again. Crash.

The reason was that when we split vertically we preserved
the GUID and Original Guid, but forgot to copy
_overriddenFields from the session being split to the new
session. Consequently, when the underlying profile was
updated in step 4 the GUID didn't appear to be overridden
and the shared GUID overwrote it. The session continued to
have divorced flag set to YES. Next time you change its font
size it checks if it needs a divorce and discovers its
profile is not in sessions instance.

2020-05-03: For inscrutable reasons, fullscreen windows
aren't added to the Window menu when the theme is minimal or
compact. Apple's long-archived "documentation" on this at
https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/WinPanel/Tasks/UsingWindowsMenu.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000231-BCIBJBDA
says:

  This menu automatically lists windows that have a title
  bar and are resizable and that can become the main window

However this is a lie because fullscreen windows don't have
a titlebar and aren't resizable regardless of theme, yet
some of them are listed in the Window menu.

By pure luck, they gave us an API to work around this
brokenness, and it's actually easy to use!

2020-05-03: Don't change selection when renaming an account
in pw manager

2020-05-02: Allow tmux windows to hang around after
