Version 3.5.15beta1 of iTerm2 was built on June 16, 2025

New Features:
- Huge improvement in throughput for printing
  ASCII text (when there are no triggers).
- Timestamps can now be shown adjacent to session
  content rather than overlapping it. You can
  configure this in Settings > Profiles > Session >
  Timestamps.
- A conversational UI for chatting with LLMs has
  been added under Window > AI Chats.
- Added Edit > Replace Selection > Replace with
  Pretty-Printed JSON. This is useful to improve
  readability of JSON and lets you hide/show
  subsections.
- Added Edit > Replace Selction > Replace with
  Base64-(En/De)code value.
- Added a new trigger that lets you modify any
  stylistic attribute of text by using SGR codes.
- The Snippets Toolbelt tool was revamped to show
  the tag-defined hierarchy.
- Menu items are now accessible through Open
  Quickly, making it into a command palette.
- There is a new key binding action, Copy Mode
  Commands, that lets you perform copy mode
  actions (e.g., enter copy mode, move the cursor
  around, make a selection, and so on).
- Added Settings > General > Experimental for
  features that are almost but not quite ready for
  prime time. Right-to-left text support and SSH
  Integration for ssh: URLs is there.
- AI settings were revamped. You can now set it to
  always use the recommended model for your
  provider so you don't have to constantly update
  it.
- When using SSH integration, there is a new menu
  item "Shell > ssh > Download Files" that opens a
  file picker that lists files on the remote host
  to download. Transfers go over ssh integration
  so no new connection needs to be made.

Other Improvements:
- If you try to set a hotkey to a commonly used
  shortcut, request confirmation.
- If you have right-to-left support enabled, it is
  now on by default in alternate screen   mode.
- Improve appearance of key bindings in settings.
- Improve appearances of some natively rendered
  powerline glyphs.
- Whitespace is now automatically trimmed from AI
  API keys.
- Add a new key binding action "Copy Interpolated
  String".
- Secure settings are now stored in /usr/local if
  your home directory is a network mount.
- Saved cursor position from DECSC is now reflowed
  when resizing.
- Background image path can now be interpolated
  strings.
- Dimming is temporarily disabled while in colors
  settings.
- The context menu now shows how strings would be
  base64 (en/de)coded.
- Navigating to the next or previous mark now
  selects the command if command selection is
  enabled.
- Improve the appearance of in-terminal buttons
  when they overlap text.
- The UI for setting "send text at start" in
  settings now has an expanding text box if you
  feel like writing a lot.
- Detect when mouse reporting and DEC 2048
  reporting was accidentally left on by watching
  for characters being echoed back.
- Semantic history now searches ancestors of the
  working directory if the path you click has a
  prefix in common with a suffix of the working
  directory.
- Some menu items now show a floating window that
  explains their purpose when you hover over them.
- Minor improvements to the appearance of the
  Composer.
- Named marks are now accessible through Open
  Quickly.
- Added a settings button to the selected command
  buttons so you can disable command selection.
- SSH integration now lets you set the path to
  ssh. You can set it in the UI under Settings >
  Profiles > General > Configure or by setting the
  SSH environment variable if you use it2ssh.
- The UI for setting up triggers and smart
  selection rules has been reworked.
- Menu items were moved around to make the Window
  menu less absurdly large.
- DEC 2048 is turned off automatically when
  the current hostname is detected to have
  changed.
- The appearance of announcements has been
  updated.
- Prevent the accent menu from appearing behind
  hotkey windows.
- Added "Settings > Profiles > Terminal >
  Click on a path in a shell prompt to open
  Navigator" to provide a new way to navigate the
  filesystem.

  hostnames can have URLs opened by control
  sequence.
- Esc now closes the Open Quickly window.
- Added the option to hide the cursor when
  keyboard focus is lost.

  baseline (but due to a bug it doesn't work with
  the GPU renderer. That will be fixed in the next
  beta).
- You can now right click on a text field in
  settings and select "Reset to default value".
- Settings search now uses a Porter stemmer for
  better recall. You can quote words or
  phrases to do literal search.
- Triggers and Smart Selection settings now show a
  beautiful railroad diagram of your regex.
- Add a new key action, Bypass Terminal, that
  allows systemwide shortcuts to be handled
  without the terminal window taking them.
- Semantic history can now be configured to send
  text instead of opening a file.
- Add support for macOS 15's feature where double
  clicking a title bar can be set in system
  settings to fill the screen.
- There is a new profile setting to automatically
  turn on alternate mouse scroll in alternate
  screen mode and another to restrict it to
  vertical movement.
- When opening settings the default profile is now
  automatically selected.
- In open quickly, you can now use /A to restrict
  results to open arrangements in tabs.
