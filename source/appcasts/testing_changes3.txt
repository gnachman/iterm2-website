3.5.0beta19

New Features
- Semantic history can now open to line number in
  Xcode.

Other Improvements
- Change shortcut for AI to Cmd-Y because Cmd-B is
  reserved for the Leader key.
- Control sequences that set color values accept
  4-digit hex values now.
- The paste history tool now has a context menu.
- Enabling CSI u mode in your profile does not
  enable Disambiguate Escapes now. This additional
  setting is now exposed in the Terminal State menu.
- Use only ASCII spaces in plain-text logs.
- Make counting ChatGPT tokens more conservative.
- Prevent Codecierge from seeing terminal contents
  when the tool is not visible.

Bug Fixes
- Fix various crashes.
- Fix a bug where quitting didn't always kill
  sessions.
- Fix drawing issues with fonts that have very
  wide ASCII glyphs.
- Fix a bug where light/dark color modes
  misbehaved in Minimal when the light theme had a
  dark background.
- Fix a bug where "interpret key bindings based on
  physical key" disregarded key bindings without a
  keycode, which is all old key bindings including
  factory defaults.
