Version 3.5.11beta1 of iTerm2 was built on November 26, 2024.

New Features
- Right-to-left text is now rendered properly.
  Enable it in Advanced Settings by searching for
  "right-to-left". Please file bugs for any
  problems you find.
- Dynamic profiles can now be written to when you
  make changes in the Settings UI. You'll need to
  add a property named "Rewritable" to dynamic
  profiles that you wish to have this ability,
  and set it to True. When you attempt to change a
  dynamic profile in settings, you'll be prompted
  to have this done for you automatically.

Improvements
- AI now gets the output of `uname -s` rather than
  `uname`. The other info uname provided was not
  useful.
- If you have enabled "^-Click reported to apps,
  does not open menu", control-click will now work
  normally when mouse reporting is off.
- When alternate screen mode is disabled, scroll
  the current screen contents into history when an
  app attempts to enter alternate screen mode.
- Short drags of the "new tab" button now act as a
  click.
- UI improvements for the "disable transparency
  for fullscreen windows by default" setting.
- If you use the 1password integration, you can
  now right-click on an account to toggle whether
  an OTP will be sent.
- Added a new button to reveal the location of
  the AI plugin, and another button to force
  iTerm2 to re-check if it is installed.
- Add support for DEC private mode 80 (sixel
  scrolling).
- Move some files from application support to
  caches.
- Cancel hiding a hotkey window if it has a modal
  sheet attached.
- In advanced paste, turn off "wait for prompt
  before pasting each line" for shells that use
  paste bracketing because that would deadlock.
- Various minor improvements to AI UIs.
- Add a UI to fix broken saved arrangements.
- When an app tries to resize the window but is
  denied, notify the user.

  option+letter, and repeated keys in nvim.

  place after showing a Sixel image.
