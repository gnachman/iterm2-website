Release notes for 3.6.0

Major New Features:
- A new AI Chat feature was added. The assistant
  can interact with the terminal, subject to your
  permission. It can also explain command output,
  adding annotations right in the terminal.

- You can now configure a profile to be a web
  browser. In Settings > Profiles >
  General, set "Profile Type" to "Web Browser".
  Many existing features already work in browser
  sessions, such as key bindings, smart selection,
  navigation, open quickly, focus follows mouse,
  and the password manager.

New Features in Terminal Sessions:
- The context menu now shows how strings would be
  base64 (en/de)coded.
- Added "Settings > Profiles > Terminal >
  Click on a path in a shell prompt to open
  Navigator" to provide a new way to navigate the
  filesystem.
- Timestamps can now be shown adjacent to terminal
  content rather than overlapping. They can also
  be configured to be relative to a particular
  line by right-clicking and selecting "Set
  Baseline for Relative Timestamps".
- Navigating to the next or previous mark now
  selects the command if command selection is
  enabled.
- Added the option to hide the cursor when
  keyboard focus is lost.
- You can now select a block of JSON and select

  Pretty-Printed JSON" to make it legible.

  phrases to do literal search.
- When opening settings the default profile is now
  automatically selected.
- Added Settings > General > Experimental for
  features that are almost but not quite ready for
  prime time. Right-to-left text support and SSH
  Integration for ssh: URLs is there.

New Key Binding Actions:
- There is a new key binding action, Copy Mode
  Commands, that lets you perform copy mode
  actions (e.g., enter copy mode, move the cursor
  around, make a selection, and so on).
- Add a new key binding action "Copy Interpolated
  String".
- Add a new key action, Bypass Terminal, that
  allows systemwide shortcuts to be handled
  without the terminal window taking them.

Triggers Improvements:
- Added a new trigger that lets you modify any
  stylistic attribute of text by using SGR codes.
- The triggers and smart selection settings UIs
  were revamped.

UI Improvements:
- The Snippets Toolbelt tool was revamped to show
  hierarchy (tags with slashes define
  directories).
- If you try to set a hotkey to a commonly used
  shortcut, you'll be asked to confirm it.
- Improve appearances of some natively rendered
  powerline glyphs.
- Improve the appearance of in-terminal buttons
  when they overlap text.

  settings now has an expanding text box if you
  feel like writing a lot.

  explains their purpose when you hover over them.

  buttons so you can disable command selection.

  results to open arrangements in tabs.
- Menu items are now accessible through Open
  Quickly, making it into a command palette.

  model which will update for you automatically
  when new models are released.

Core Improvements:
- Performance improvements when showing lots of
  text (provided there are no triggers).
- Automatic profile switching job rules now match
  against the full command line as well as just
  the job name

  prefix in common with a suffix of the working

  text instead of opening a file.

Terminal Emulation Improvements:
- Saved cursor position from DECSC is now reflowed

  reporting was accidentally left on by watching

  turn on alternate mouse scroll in alternate
  screen mode and another to restrict it to
  vertical movement.

SSH Integration Improvements:
- SSH integration now lets you set the path to
  ssh. You can set it in the UI under Settings >
  Profiles > General > Configure or by setting the
  SSH environment variable if you use it2ssh.
- File open/save panels now have the option to
  show SSH hosts when you are connected with SSH
  integration. So, for example, when you use
  `it2ul` to upload a file, you could pick a file on
  a different host that you're already connected
  to.
- When using SSH integration, there is a new menu
  item "Shell > ssh > Download Files" that opens a
  file picker that lists files on the remote host
  to download. Transfers go over ssh integration
  so no new connection needs to be made.

Security Improvements:
- Secure settings are now used to record which
  hostnames can have URLs opened by control
  sequence.
