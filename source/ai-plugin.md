### iTerm2 AI Plugin
This is an optional component you can install to enable generative AI features in iTerm2.

It provides necessary functionality for iTerm2 to make network requests. It exists as a separate component to ensure that there's no way to accidentally send information from the terminal over the network.

#### How to Install
Download the package and unzip it. Place in `/Applications`. You don't need to run it; iTerm2 will locate it automatically.
