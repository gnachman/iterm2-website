This is a minor update over 3.4.9, whose release
notes are below.

Bug fixes:
- Fix a bug where annotations were not visible.
- Fix a bug where row highlighting when navigating
  among marks didn't work sometimes.

3.4.9

New Features
- Add support for new keyboard reporting mode
  control sequences:
  - CSI > u  Push key reporting mode
  - CSI < u  Pop key reporting mode
  - CSI ? u  Query key reporting mode
- When you select hex characters and open the
  context menu their base-10 equivalent is shown.
- Add Undo Close to menu so that you can bind a
  keystroke to it. It undoes closing the last
  session/tab/window.
- You can now enable and disable triggers both on
  a per-profile basis and per-session. You can do
  this through the usual prefs UIs and also
  through the Session > Triggers menu.
- Add "Clear to Last Mark" and "Clear to Start of
  Selection" menu items.
- Add an option to disable triggers in interactive
  applications.
- You can now importa nd export snippets.
- Add a profile preference to open the password
  manager automatically when a password prompt is
  detected.
- Dynamic profiles may now name a "Dynamic Profile
  Parent GUID" rather than "Dynamic Profile Parent
  Name" to avoid breaking things when you rename a
  profile with children.
- Timestamps can now be configured to show when
  the mouse hovers over the right edge of the
  window.

Other Improvements
- In tmux integration the tmux server will now
  remember user-set tab titles.
- Preserve existing percent encoding when
  cmd-clicking a URL.
- Avoid setting TTY's size when switching away
  from a tab.
- Verbiage improvements to tmux dashboard.
- Improvements to escaping when sending text via
  key binding action or snippets. Backaslashes can
  now reliably be sent by escaping them as \\.
  Existing key bindings and snippets will not
  change behavior until edited.
- Sliders in prefs now include a text field
  showing the actual value.
- The window menu now indicates windows'
  shortcuts.
- Don't select tabs on mouse-down when option is
  pressed so that you can option-drag a
  non-selected tab.
- Set COPYFILE_DISABLE before creating an archive
  to send with it2ul to not include extended
  attributes files.
- Add Edit Triggers to Session menu.
- If the current directory is a symlink remember
  it more reliably when creating a new session
  that reuses the previous session's directory.
- Upload and download colors in the network usage
  status bar component configurable.
- Prevent triggers that run commands from eating
  infinite CPU if there are too many of them by
  limiting the number that can run concurrently.
- Detect when triggers create a performance
  problem and offer to disable them in interactive
  apps.
- Page up, page down, home, and end now scroll
  when you are not in an interactive app. There is

- Fix a bug where the git status bar didn't work
  when outside the root of a repo.

The release notes for 3.4.5 follow:

3.4.5

New Features:
- Add preference to allow/disallow apps changing
  the function of the option keys with a control
  sequence.
- Add a menu item to pop the current session into
  a new window.
- The git status bar now indicates the repo state

  line. This is useful because matching .*foo.* is
  very slow. With this trigger you can simply
  match foo and the whole line changes color.

Improvements

  out to the system git. It uses libgit2 instead
  (nicely named!) and should be faster and more
  reliable now.

  shortcuts.
- Ignore dynamic profiles whose filename ends in a
  tilde.

  treat a backslash in the last column as a
  continuation mark and don't include it.
- By default, save terminal contents to history
  when there is a scrolling region that touches
  the top of the screen.
- Newly saved window arrangements will restore to
  the right size when scroller style changes after
  they were created (unless there are side-by-side
  split panes).
- Treat soft hyphens as unicode punctuation in
  Advanced Paste.

Bug Fixes

  use the wrong thickness for text.

  ~/.iterm2-1 cannot be created/used as writable
  directories.

<pre id="changelist4271945246519584321" style="display: none">3.4.6

This is a minor bugfix release over 3.4.5, which
was not widely distributed.

- Fix crashing bugs.
- Fix a bug where the git status bar didn't work
  when outside the root of a repo.

The release notes for 3.4.5 follow:

3.4.5

New Features:
- Add preference to allow/disallow apps changing
  the function of the option keys with a control
  sequence.
- Add a menu item to pop the current session into
  a new window.
- The git status bar now indicates the repo state
  (merging, reverting, cherrypicking, bisecting,
  rebasing, or applying).
- When you right click on a hex color like #ffeedd
  show a preview of the color in sRGB in the
  context menu.
- Add a new type of trigger to highlight the whole
  line. This is useful because matching .*foo.* is
  very slow. With this trigger you can simply
  match foo and the whole line changes color.

Improvements
- The git status bar component no longer shells
  out to the system git. It uses libgit2 instead
  (nicely named!) and should be faster and more
  reliable now.
- When known, the current git branch is used as a
  search feature in Open Quickly.
- Don't show a line between the titlebar and
  tabbar in Big Sur.
- Increase max allowed blur on macOS 10.14.
- When you move a window to a different screen by
  selecting the Move To Screen menu item, it will
  lose its affinity for the window assigned to it
  in Prefs > Profiles > Window and stay where it
  was put when screens are added or removed.
- Buttons in modal alerts now accept cmd+letter
  shortcuts.
- Ignore dynamic profiles whose filename ends in a
  tilde.
- Reset terminal when relaunching a session (e.g.,
  paste bracketing and mouse reporting).
- The composer window now uses the terminal's
  font.
- Scrolling with the trackpad should be more
  responsive now.
- Change how text is drawn when not using GPU
  renderer to avoid artifacts.
- When doing selection respecting soft boundaries,
  treat a backslash in the last column as a
  continuation mark and don't include it.
- By default, save terminal contents to history
  when there is a scrolling region that touches
  the top of the screen.
- Newly saved window arrangements will restore to
  the right size when scroller style changes after
  they were created (unless there are side-by-side
  split panes).
- Treat soft hyphens as unicode punctuation in
  Advanced Paste.

Bug Fixes
- Fix a bug where doublecliking on a session
  titlebar didn't maximize tmux panes correctly.
- Fix clipped button next to status bar search
  field.
- Blur is now correct after changing window type
  or theme.
- Fix a bug where a window forgot it was blurred
  when toggling traditional fullscreen in Minimal
  theme.
- Fix a bug where windows would restore on the
  wrong desktop.
- Fixes a bug where the GPU renderer gets stuck
  "off" when the "Reduce motion" accessibility
  setting is enabled and a window is maximized.
- Fix a bug where control+shift+function/arrow key
  sent the wrong code.
- Fix a bug where the app could hang after certain
  trackpad touches.
- Fix a bug where copy on selection didn't always
  work.
- Fix a bug where transparent windows changed
  colors in native full screen mode.
- Fix a bug where keystrokes bound to menu items
  didn't always work.
- Fix crashes.
- Fix a bug where disabling
  middle-click-to-close-a-tab also breaks the tab
  close button.
- Fix keystroke filtering in the Python APi which
  seems have been broken for some time.
- Fix various bugs with HTML tab titles: remove
  HTML for window title and tooltips.
- Fix a bug where inline images downscaled
  with artifacts in the GPU renderer.
- Fix a crash on launch if ~/.config/iterm2 is not
  able to be created and is not already a
  directory.
- Fix a bug where tab icons were flipped
  vertically on macOS 10.14.
- Fix a bug where the GPU renderer would sometimes
  use the wrong thickness for text.
- Fix various bugs around snippets with the same
  title.
- Don't crash if ~/.config/iterm2, ~/.iterm2, and
  ~/.iterm2-1 cannot be created/used as writable
  directories.
- Fix rendering bugs in background images with
  transparency.
- When HTML titles are enabled, remove the tags
  from various places like notifications.
- Don't crash when pseudoterminals are exhausted.
- Fix a bug where windows would be empty after
  changing screen.
- Fix a bug where no terminal content was shown
  when dragging a tab.
- Fix a bug where underlines appeared offset.
- Fix a bug where transparency and blur would
  sometimes be wrong.

  "stable layout" algorithm and a fixed-size
  spacer.

  more than one click to scroll.

  OpenBSD 6.8.

Annoying things I'm sorry about
- You'll be asked to re-install the Python
  runtime. This fixes a problem where pip3 would
  sometimes fail. Instead of creating a symlink
  of ~/Library/ApplicationSupport we will now use
  ~/.config/iterm2/AppSupport.

New Features
- Tab titles now parse very basic HTML tags for
  bold, italic, and underline. Less-than and
  ampersand entites are also recognized.
- Margins are now adjustable in Prefs >
  Appearance > Panes.
- Add an option to save prefs to a custom folder
  automatically.
- The composer now integrates with command history
  and makes completion suggestions.
- When you right click on text with a hyperlink,
  "Copy Link Address" is now available in the
  context menu.

Improvements
- The changelog now has a PGP signature.
- Improve performance of opening lots of tabs at
  once.
- Improve performance when changing prefs that
  affect many tabs.
- Tabs are now selected on mouse down rather than
  on mouse up.
- Hide tab close button on small tabs to prevent
  accidental closure.
- Confirm deleting entries in the password
  manager.
- Tab icons are now always left aligned and get
  replaced with the close button on hover.

- Recognize U+251C and U+2524 as column dividers
  for selection's soft boundaries.
- Reduce minimum dimming amount allowed in Prefs >
  Appearance > Dimming.
- Use terminal background color to determine
  appearance of composer.
- You can now use Cmd-W to dismiss the composer.
- Don't show an alert if the initial tmux
  integration command fails.
- When you split a pane in tmux integration and
  focus follows mouse is on, don't make the pane
  under the mouse active. Make the new pane
  active.
- New tmux windows created outside iTerm2 (e.g.,
  by running `tmux new-window`) will become tabs
  in the current window.
- Give backpressure to commands run in the
  background (e.g., from triggers) to keep them
  from hogging CPU.
- Improve performance of creating a new session in
  a custom directory.
- Improve performance when there are big
  background images.
- The composer now clears the existing command by
  sending C-U C-K.
- Handle "Default_Ignorable" unicode characters
  correctly.

  explainshell.com.
- When you hold down cmd while dragging in a file
  from Finder, insert a command to cd to its
  containing folder.
- The GPU renderer now draws a frame at least
  every half second to prevent a brief hang after
  inactivity.

Bug Fixes

- Fix a bug where on Big Sur transparency doesn't
  work with background images.
- Fix $$$$ in profile commands, which should be
  replaced with $$.

  application cursor mode is on. This caused
  problems in vim.

  background images in GPU renderer to be
  consistent with legacy renderer.

- There is a new profile preference to configure
  whether mouse reporting of clicks and drags are
  allowed.

  behind with the ability to catch up quickly.
  NOTE: tmux 3.2 has not yet been released.
- tmux integration windows will now keep their
  size the same as you create or destroy split
  panes.
- Adds a preference to exclude iTerm2 from the
  dock and cmd-tab app switcher only if all
  windows are hotkey windows.

Improvements
- Various performance improvements.

  instead of a TCP socket for better performance.
  The security model has also changed: apps can
  authenticate via Applescript or you can choose
  to allow all programs running locally to use the
  API.
- Use a single daemon process for all sessions
  instead of one per session. This reduces the
  number of process IDs used and also improves the
  time to launch a new session.
- Background images are significantly faster when
  not using the GPU renderer.
- Most tables now allow multiple selection.
- The number of search results is now shown in the
  Find on Page UI.
- Dynamic profiles now works with symlinks. Even
  the DynamicProfiles folder itself may be a
  symlink.

  container format that signs the entire file
  except the signature itself.
- Improve cold launch time.
- Countless minor improvements and polishing.
- Big Sur supported.
- Permission is now requested before various
  possibly destructive or annoying activities are
  done in response to control sequences.

  originating from the built-in keyboard.
- The profile preference "Send text at start" is
  now an interpolated string.
- The profile preference "Custom command" is
  now an interpolated string.
- The feature where the scroll wheel sends arrow
  keys when in alternate screen mode now works
  even when alternate screen mode is disabled.
- Enable window shadow for transparent windows.
- When resizing the window while scrolled up in to
  history, keep the text in the top left locked in
  position.
- Show a brief message when automatic profile
  switching takes effect.
- Send a newline before sending the curl command
  to install shell integration to clear out any
  existing command.
- Disable GPU renderer for obscured windows when
  using the integrated GPU.
- When a tmux pane fails to split, don't detach.
- Remember tmux window sizes when reattaching.
- When disintering a buried tmux tab, put it back
  in the right position in the same window it came
  from.
- Draw outline on right hand side of last tab in
  minimal theme.
- Hide subpixel antialiasing UI on big sur because
  Apple took it away from us :(

Bug Fixes
- Full screen windows in the Minimal or Compact
  theme did not used to get restored properly and
  now they do.

This is a bugfix release for 3.3.10, which was
short-lived. The release notes for 3.3.10 are
included below.

- Fixes a bug introduced in 3.3.10 where the dock
  and menu bar would sometimes remain hidden after
  exiting non-native fullscreen.
- Works around a possible macOS bug where Metal
  drops frames occasionally.
- Fixes a bug where the advanced setting to not
  create an ApplicationSupport symlink was
  ignored.

3.3.10

Security Improvements
- Improves the method for gaining authorization
  to run Python scripts launched from outside
  iTerm2.

  Version 3.3.9 deprecated the older auth
  mechanism based on the command line, requiring
  the user to consent to every connection. That
  was annoying.

  There are now two ways to get permission:

  1. The UI prompts on every connection.
  2. The app requests a cookie using Applescript.
     Therefore, Applescript permission is
     required. This requires the user to
     consent only once per app that originates the
     connection.

  Note that this does not affect scripts launched
  by iTerm2, such as those opened from the Scripts
  menu.

  For more information, including details on how
  to use osascript to get a cookie, please see:
  https://iterm2.com/python-api-security-model

New Features:
- Updated shell integration installer UI, now with
  internet-free install option.
- Add a setting to Edit Session to prevent
  Automatic Profile Switching from changing the
  profile.
- Add support for opening files to line number
  with IntelliJ.
- Applescript can now launch a Python API script
  from an absolute path.

Improvements:
- Add a delay before previewing a color preset to
  make it easier to navigate the menu quickly.
- Set SSL_CERT_FILE and SSL_CERT_DIR when running
  Python scripts so they can use TLS.
- Change "Broken Pipe" to "Session Ended" and make
  it a soothing blue color.
- Network filesystems can not hang the UI any
  more. Calls to proc_pidinfo are now made in an
  XPC server.
- Default to built-in mouse cursor on Catalina
  since it is now visible against a black
  background.
- Updated internet access policy for all outgoing
  connections.
- Improve appearance of items in the Uploads and
  Downloads menus.

Security Improvements
- Improves the method for gaining authorization
  to run Python scripts launched from outside
  iTerm2.

  Version 3.3.9 deprecated the older auth
  mechanism based on the command line, requiring
  the user to consent to every connection. That
  was annoying.

  There are now two ways to get permission:

  1. The UI prompts on every connection.
  2. The app requests a cookie using Applescript.
     Therefore, Applescript permission is
     required. This requires the user to
     consent only once per app that originates the
     connection.

  Note that this does not affect scripts launched
  by iTerm2, such as those opened from the Scripts
  menu.

  For more information, including details on how
  to use osascript to get a cookie, please see:
  https://iterm2.com/python-api-security-model

New Features:

This release fixes a number of crashes and adds a security
improvement to the Python API.

Security Improvements
- The security model for the Python API has changed. Any
  process attempting to use the API that was not launched by
  iTerm2 will require explicit user approval.

  The previous technique, which relied on inferring the job
  name from its command line, could be subverted.

  Consequently, the UI for authorizing particular scripts
  has been removed.

  For more information, please see
  https://iterm2.com/python-api-security-model

Bug Fixes
- Fix a bug where the character accent menu would appear
  when holding down a key.
- Fix crash when restoring window arrangement.
- Fix crash when a download finishes.
- Fix crash when a downloaded file has disappeared.
- Fix crash after closing a window that completely obscures
  another window and the GPU renderer is enabled.
- Fix crash when there is no default fixed-pitch font.
- Fix crash when removing invalid automatic profile
  switching rule.
- Fix crash when a bonjour host appears/disappears and the
  default profile has a hotkey and you're switched to a
  different user account than the one iTerm2 is in.
- Enable same-origin policy for webkit popovers.
- Fix a crash when a shortcut is configured to invoke a menu
  item that has a submenu.
- Fix a crash when a tab icon is 0x0 pixels.
- Fix a crash when there's a process ID cycle.
- Fix a bug where shortcuts are shown in tabs when
  navigation by modifiers+number is disabled.
- Fix various other crashes.

Version 3.3.8 was a short-lived release. Its release notes
follow:

3.3.8

New Features
- You can now specify that a profile should use a "custom
  shell". With this option, you can ask to use a particular
  shell (e.g., /usr/local/bin/fish) without having to update
  your Unix account with chsh. Such sessions are launched through
  /usr/bin/login, which initializes them properly.
- Add a new status bar component that opens a menu with a
  list of actions. Actions are defined by the toolbelt
  Actions tool.
- You can now log plain text, both for automatic logging and
  for one-off logging from the menu.
- Adds a new built-in color preset, Smoooooth. Works around
  bloom issues on Pro Display XDR.
- Add "Send Selection" to context menu.
- Dynamic Profiles now log errors to the scripting
  console.

Improvements
- Add reordering and multiple selection to the Actions
  toolbelt tool.
- Add actions in the Actions tool to the Open Quickly
  window.
- Speed up Open Quickly window animation.
- Change how shortcuts in the Open Quickly window work to
  not require a space. For example, /afoo will now find
  window arrangements matching the search query "foo".
  Previously, you'd need to put a space after "/a".
- Save search history outside of user defaults for better
  privacy.
- Tighten up image decoding sandboxes. There were some
  permissions that aren't needed by the currently supported
  versions of macOS.
- Copy mode now supports moving forward and back by a vim
  "WORD" with W and B. A WORD can contain symbols, as
  opposed to a word which is approximately alphanumeric.
- Be more paranoid about parsing imported recording files.
- Sandbox sixel image decoding.
- Improve the reliability of three-finger-drag-to-select.
- Downloaded files (e.g., with it2dl) are now quarantined.
- When a session's current directory is fetched from the OS,
  rewrite root-firmlinked paths to their more familiar
  aliases.
- Add more advanced preferences to tame the dumpster fire
  that is Consolas.
- Restore tmux windows' positions more consistently in tmux
  integration mode.
- As you select items in the color presets menu, temporarily
  apply them so you can see the effect.
- Signed script archives now sign the entire file (other
  than the signature itself) to prevent tampering with
  embedded certs. For now older archives are still accepted
  as input.
- Require user permission for various control sequences that
  could possibly be abused for evil purposes.
- Separate next/previous mark and next/previous annotation
  into separate menu items.
- Various performance improvements.
- Three-finger drags are now reported when three finger
  drags are configured to act as regular left mouse drags.
- Use momentum scrolling for mouse reporting the scroll
  wheel.
- Remove various unneeded entitlements for extra security.
- Changes to custom touch bar items are now reflected
  immediately.
- Deal with attempting to attach twice to the same tmux
  session more nicely.
- User-defined variables are now saved in the tmux server
  and restored upon attaching in tmux integration mode.
- Add "Ignore" as a new pointer action.
- If Paste is waiting for a prompt and you press either
  control-C or esc, the paste will be aborted.
- Add an advanced pref to force antialiasing on retina
  displays, even when AA is disabled in Text prefs.[
- Use hardened runtimes in helper programs.
- Use secure timestamps everywhere.

Bug Fixes
- Voice dictation now works!
- Fix incorrect handling of three finger taps that caused
  the dictionary to open.
- Fix gray bar that appeared when in native full screen with
  one tab and no tab bar.
- Fix a bug where the title could be misaligned in the
  Minimal theme.
- Fix off-center red/yellow/green buttons in Minimal theme.
- Fix various crashes.
- Improve argument parsing for identifying Python scripts
  that use the API.
- Fix improper text alignment in font picker.
- Duplicate Tab now respects the advanced pref that controls
  where new tabs are added.
- Fix a bug where the shorcut for switching
  panes/tabs/window by number could show the wrong modifiers
  in the settings UI.
- Don't convert control sequences from screen to xterm in
  tmux integration if the default-terminal tmux option is
  set to something not including 'screen'.
- Fix a bug where tmux integration would get confused about
  which tab is which after reordering them.
- Fix a bug where editing a trigger's regex could update the
  first row instead of the one you were editing.
- Don't show the "document edited" dot in the close button
  when the profile has a custom command, which tricked us
  into thinking it was always edited.
- Fix a bug where the tab title could become empty after
  popping a title from the stack (such as when exiting vim). 
- Don't hang when importing a script with a self-signed
  cert.
- Improve how the git status bar component truncates text.
- The GPU renderer drew selected tab characters incorrectly.
  Fix it.
- Disable quicklook for http, since it won't work anyway due
  to ATS.
- Fix bugs in restoring annotations that would cause them to
  change what text was annotated.
- Fix the git status bar tool in directories with tildes in
  their names.
- Fix crazy big mouse cursor when screen sharing.
- Don't do crazy things if you try to mouse report past the
  223rd row/column in xterm mouse reporting mode.
- Fix printing of images in black-and-white mode.
- Fix a bug where "select menu item" actions got performed
  twice.
- Fix a bug where the dock got hidden on the wrong screen
  when entering full screen.
- You can now assign force click to smart select and it'll
  work the way you'd expect.
- .its files now have proper icons and are bound to iTerm2.
- Fix a bug where background images would sometimes not
  update right away when using the GPU renderer.
- Make highlighted search results in the profile list more
  legible in dark mode.

Things Made Worse
- Remove the CPU profiling feature. It was never very good
  and the command line "sample" program is better.
- Tab icons are no longer supported on macOS 10.12 because
  Apple made a dog's breakfast of drawing images in the
  10.15 SDK.

<pre id="changelist5359538256657707145" style="display: none">iTerm2 version 3.3.7

New Features
- Adds a preference to specify whether you want
  each tab to control the window title
  separately, or if all tabs in a window should
  share a single window title. This affects window
  title set by control sequences like OSC 2.
- Separate 'use custom bold color' from 'brighten
  bold colors', which previously were confusingly
  grouped into a single setting.
- Password manager now has a column for user
  names.
- Add support for 2-factor codes appended to
  password in password manager.

Improvements
- Various performance improvements.
- When the window title is changed by a control
  sequence, set the window title to exactly that
  string.

  expanded in toolbelt.
- Move selection-related settings into General >
  Selection.

  Minimal theme when the terminal window's
  background is dark.
- Add Unicode 12 width tables for emoji.
- Add "Edit Account Name" and "Edit User Name" to
  password manager context menu.
- Variable-size tmux windows are now pretty
  usable. Try turning on Prefs>Advanced>Allow
  variable window sizes in tmux integration.
- Put a dot in the close button when there is an
  active job running.
- You can now drag the window using the New Tab +
  button.
- When selecting a tag from the "tags" view, use
  the tag: operator to restrict the search term to
  tags.

  integration. It uses the "screen" terminal where
  the control sequence normally used for italics
  instead does reverse video.

Bug Fixes
- Disable quicklook if it's disabled systemwide.
- Fix drawing of "tags" view of profile list.
- Fix bug where users with spaces in their names
  couldn't log in.
- Fix a bug where windows with a left-side tab bar
  had the wrong number of columns when first
  created.

  an inactive tab would activate the wrong session
  in that tab.

  showing Profile + Session name caused the
  profile name to go away.

- In secure copy, keyboard-interactive and private
  key passpharse input deadlocked. Fix it.
- Preserve the selected weight when changing
  typeface, when possible.
- Respect the desired popover size for custom
  status bar components. This fix may cause some
  popovers to have different-sized popovers than
  expected, and may require updating the script to
  correct.
- Fix a bug where Find Next would not navigate to
  the very first word in history.
- Fix a runaway CPU issue when initializing GPU
  renderer.
- Touch bar in full screen now shows correct tab
  titles. Fixes a bug where they would get out of

This build fixes a serious security issue. All
users should upgrade.

The Mozilla Foundation has generously sponsored a
security audit of the iTerm2 source code. As part
of this audit, a problem was discovered which
could cause iTerm2 to issue commands in response
to receiving certain input. This is a serious
security issue because in some circumstances it
could allow an attacker to execute commands on
your machine when you view a file or otherwise
receive input they have crafted in iTerm2.

For more information, please visit the
iterm2-discuss group.

This is a major release that contains a number of
new features.

Major New Features

- A Python scripting API has been added to enable
  extensive configuration and customization. See
  https://iterm2.com/python-api for details.
- A scriptable status bar has been added with 13
  built-in configurable components.
- Two new themes:
    Minimal: Reduces visual clutter. Modernist.
    Compact: Moves tabs into the title bar to save
      space, while preserving the general
      appearance of a macOS app.

Other New Features

- Session, tab, and window titles have been
  revamped to be more flexible and comprehensible.
  You can now configure them separately and select
  what information is shown per profile. They are
  integrated with the new Python scripting API.
- Tabs may now have icons: either an icon
  indicating the running app, or a fixed icon per
  profile.
- The display of Sixel images is now supported.
- Add menu item to arrange split panes evenly. In
  tmux, this uses the tiled layout.
- Greatly improved support for background images:
  they may now span split panes and you can adjust
  how they are scaled to avoid stretching.
- Add support for reporting keystrokes with CSI u.
- New type of trigger added that turns text into a
  hyperlink.
- New type of trigger added that adds annotations
  to the matching text.
- You can now export a recording of your screen
  from the Instant Replay panel.
- A new toolbelt tool, Actions, provides shortcuts
  to frequent actions like sending a snippet of
  text.
- You can now search preferences. There's a search
  bar in the top right of the window.
- Add a new utility, "it2git", which allows the
  git status bar component to show git state on a
  remote host. Install the utilities and then view
  ~/.iterm2/it2git for further instructions.

  visually pleasing.
- A new menu item lets you configure cmd-+ and
  cmd-- to adjust the underlying profile rather
  than only the current session.

  other elements, which the Powerline fonts do not
  always do.

  of color presets.
- Change natural text editing keyboard preset to
  include cmd-left and cmd-right.

  the tmux server when changing panes.
- When the current tab is closed select the one to
  its right, like standard macOS tabs.
- Work around a macOS quirk where the equals sign
  on the numeric keypad is not treated as a
  numeric keypad key.

  tab label over the new-output/bell icon.
- Add an advanced setting to handle spacing
  combining marks properly ("Detect base unicode
  characters with lookup table").
- Respect System "Prefs>Dock>Prefer tabs when
  opening documents".

Bug fixes
---------
- Fix a crash on launch if Safari has never been
  run before. This happened because of a bug in
  checking if full disk access was already granted.
- Fix the alpha blending of timestamps with GPU
  renderer.
- Fix various crash bugs.
- Fix a bug where the GPU renderer was not used
  when a split pane was maximized.
- Improve opening a password manager from a
  trigger: it would fail if the trigger fired
  twice quickly.
- Improve various wrong colors in Mojave.
- Fix a bug wher elink underlines could be
  misaligned in the presence of double-width
  characters.

  was a hotkey window when you launched tmux -CC
  from it.

Other improvements
------------------
- Performance improvements for large history.
- Remember the "use transparency" setting when
  restoring a window.
- Issue a vociferous warning when you try to use
  non-antialiased PragmataPro, which doesn't work
  well at all.
- Show a second alert to remind you of the steps
  to perform to grant full disk access.
- When you drag a pane over a tab with a maximized
  pane, unmaximize it temporarily but do not send
  window-resize notifications to those 
  pseudoterminals.
- Change how the secure keyboard entry menu item
  works. It now indicates enabled (check) disabled
  (no accessory view) or "another app is enablign
  it" (a hyphen). Selecting it toggles whether
  iTerm2 wants it set. Previously, selecting it had
  no effect if another app was keeping it on.
- Fix weird behavior when downgrading from 3.3 to
  3.2.
- Adds a CPU profiler to the iTerm2 menu to aid in
  debugging performance issues.

  notarized under macOS Mojave.

<pre id="changelist3566543841203470061" style="display: none">iTerm2 3.2.0

The big new feature in iTerm2 version 3.2 is a new rendering
engine that uses Metal. It provides much higher drawing
performance. Its availability is subject to some
configuration settings. For details, see
https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/Metal-Renderer.

New Features
------------
- Metal renderer
- Show inline images in Retina resolution.
- There is a new key binding action to toggle mouse
  reporting.
- Semantic history now recognizes visual studio code-style
  "filename[line, column]" references.
- There's a new type of trigger that turns text into a
  hyperlink.
- Add support for VS Code Insiders to semantic history's
  editors.
- Warn if the terminal tries to access the clipboard when it
  lacks permission rather than silently denying it.
- Change ReportCellSize to include a scale factor, which
  gives how much images will be downscaled by because of
  Retina support.
- New advanced pref: Fraction of character’s width on its
  right side that can be used to select the character to its
  right.
- New advanced pref: Open a new window when you click the
  dock icon and no windows are already open?
- New advanced pref: When Focus Follows Mouse is enabled,
  activate the window under the cursor when iTerm2 becomes
  active?
- New advanced pref: Underline Semantic History-selectable
  items under the cursor while holding cmd?
- You can now escape $$ in an Applescript profile command
  with $$$$
- New advanced pref (affecting semantic history's URL
  detection): URLs must contain a scheme?
- New advanced pref: Minimum weight difference between
  regular and bold font.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Triggers and Find now recognize tab characters.
- Fix a bug where Triggers and Find would sometimes not see
  past a double-width character that was wrapped to the next
  line.
- When you drag a session onto itself in a window with split
  panes, do not move the window.
- Don't allow fullscreen or edge-attached windows to be
  moved with cmd-opt-shift-drag.
- Fix the color picker's eyedropper feature to respect color
  spaces.
- If multiple hotkey windows are open, do not return to the
  previously active app when one is closed.
- When changing the number of lines of scrollback, do not
  apply the change until focus leaves the text field. This
  solves a problem where erasing the value would erase your
  history.
- Scrolling with wheel mice is no longer oversensitive.
- Change behavior of prompt-before-closing for tmux
  integration. Since the list of jobs is not visible, always
  prompt when a whitelist of jobs is specified.
- Fix a bug where changing the cursor shape by escape
  sequence could be reverted by changing any profile
  property.
- When the password manager fails to get a password because
  the system Keychain denied access, show an alert
  explaining what happened.
- Ignore modifier+number when there's no matching
  pane/tab/window to switch to rather than passing it to the
  terminal as a keypress.
- Fix a bug where cmd-0 did not restore the original font
  size in tmux integration.
- Ignore malformed OSC 11.
- Fixes a bug where images could be drawn in the wrong
  column.
- Improved behavior of Yen key sending backslash for
  Japanese keyboards.
- "Select Current Command" works while the command
   is running
- Fix a bug where the offer to turn off paste bracketing
  didn't actually turn off paste bracketing.
- Fix a bug where a floating hotkey window overlapped the
  emoji panel.
- Improve reliability of entering native full screen.

Other improvements
------------------
- When a split pane in tmux integration mode closes the
  nearest neighbor gets keyboard focus rather than the first
  split pane in the tab.
- When not in alternate screen mode, tab will change the
  background color of cells the cursor skipped over. This
  violates tradition but is more sensible behavior for
  printing syntax-highlighted code with tabs.
- Inset marks by one pixel on the left margin.
- The rendering of faint text has been changed to take the
  background color into account.
- The toolbelt tools look nicer in the dark schemes.
- The pointing hand cursor will show only while over a
  clickable item while holding cmd.
- Tab name truncation no longer takes a parenthesized (job)
  name at the end into account when deciding whether to
  truncate the head or tail.
- Add an option to share the tip of the day.
- Treat { and } as shell characters to escape.

  text.
- Trim trailing newline and adjacent whitespace when selecting the output of the
  last command.
- Reduce minimum adaptive frame rate to 20 fps.
- Send prefs as XML in crash reports to make it easier to reproduce.
- Improve performance of finding word boundaries. This should fix occasional
  hangs when pressing cmd while the mouse hovers over a very long word.
- Dim the cursor when dimming a window's contents.
- Add an advanced preference to make the "session restored" banner optional.

<pre id="changelist5309173370209724874" style="display: none">Major New Features
------------------
- Deep tmux integration!
  Have you ever had an ssh session lost because you had to reboot, had a network
  failure, or the power went out? Are you tired of giving up a keystroke to tmux
  or screen? Suffer no longer! iTerm2 and tmux are now deeply integrated. By
  installing a special version of tmux, it gains the ability to speak directly to
  iTerm2. When you run tmux with -CC, iTerm2 will open real, native windows or
  tabs for each tmux window. The whole state of your tmux session is reflected in
  native iTerm2 windows. As you interact with a window, your typing is sent back
  to tmux. Any time you resize a window, add a split pane, close a split pane,
  close a window, or open a window (with Shell-&gt;tmux-&gt;new window), that
  action happens in tmux as well as in iTerm2.
  All the details are at https://code.google.com/p/iterm2/wiki/TmuxIntegration

- A "Toolbelt" has been added. It's a drawer that opens to the right of a
  window and shows running jobs, paste history, a field for taking notes, and
  lets you open new windows/tabs/splits. Look for the Toolbelt menu.

- Add "triggers." A trigger is an action that is performed when text matching
  some regular expression is received in a terminal session. More info here:
  http://www.iterm2.com/triggers.html

- Add "coprocesses." A coprocess is a process, such as a script, that receives
  input from a terminal and whose output is fed into the terminal session as
  though the user were typing it. You can use them to automate interaction with
  scripts, download files with ZModem, and more. More info here:
  http://iterm2.com/coprocesses.html

- You can now edit the smart selection regexes in
  Prefs&gt;Profiles&gt;Advanced. You can also assign actions that are added to
  the context menu when you right click on text that matches a smart selection
  rule.  More info here:
  http://www.iterm2.com/smartselection.html

- Support for OS 10.7 features including fullscreen, retina graphics, and
  window restoration.


New Preferences
---------------
- Add support for tiled background images (Foy Savas)
- Add a preference to toggle hiding of the menu bar in non-Lion fullscreen.
  Useful in Mavericks multi-monitor setups.
- Make tabview toggleable in fullscreen.

- Add preference to disable dimming animation.
- Add option to profiles to send text to shell at startup.
- Add option to disable session-initiated printing.
- Add support for loading prefs from a custom folder (e.g., Dropbox) or URL.
  This makes it easy to share a config between multiple machines or people.
- Add auto logging of sessions. When enabled (per-profile), all input received
  from the host in a session is saved to a file tagged with the window, tag,
  and pane number, plus the time and date of initiation.
- Add next/previous pane action.
- Change around prompt-to-quit options, adding "always/never/only if jobs
  besides ... are running" to profiles-sessions.
- Add option to copy trailing newlines when making a selection that includes a
  whole line at its end.
- Add preference to disable transparency when entering fullscreen mode.
- Improve "Terminal.app Compatibility" key preset to more accurately emulate
  Terminal.
- You can now configure what happens when you cmd-click on a filename in
  Prefs&gt;Profiles&gt;Advanced.

  entries.
- Add hidden variable URLCharacterSet that defines characters that are part of
  a URL.
- Disable title reporting unless hidden pref AllowInsecureTitleReporting is set
  to true.
- Add general preference "Adjust window for font size change". Turn it off so
  that the window size stays fixed as the font grows or shrinks (thanks,
  keeyipchan!).
- Add hidden preference PinchToChangeFontSizeDisabled to turn off pinch to
  change font size
- Ask for confirmation before deleting a profile.
- Add boolean hidden pref, OpenFileInNewWindows. When you open a file (e.g., a
  shell script) in finder with iTerm2, this controls whether it opens in a new
window or tab.
- Additional window styles: bottom and left of screen.

New Terminal Features
---------------------
- Add support for italics (Stefan Schüßler)
- Change RIS code to move the cursor to the origin (saitoha).
- Convert text to NFC form more aggressively, which should lead to latin
  characters with accents rendering more consistently with certain fonts like
  Inconsolata, which lacks some combining marks.
- Add ITERM_SESSION_ID environment variable that identifiers the window, tab,
  and pane number of each session.
- Add escape code "Esc c" to reset terminal.
- Add new escape code ESC ]6;1;bg;*;default^G to restore tab color to default.

  terminal sends esc[I when focusing, esc[O when de-focusing. Send esc[?1004l
  to disable.
- Implemented bracketed paste mode (this is cool, see vim script here:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5585129
- Define VLNEXT and VDISCARD in the term by default.

- Add support for OSC 52 (clipboard integration--thanks, saitoha!).
- Add support for DECSCUSR which lets the terminal change the cursor shape and
  blink.
- Add support for DECSTR (esc [!p)

Other Features
--------------
- Improve rendering on glyphs with multiple combining marks.
- When you cmd-click on a filename in a diff, remove the a/ or b/ prefix and
  replace with the real directory to open the file.
- Cmd-opt click on a URL to open it without bringing the browser to the front.
- Improve "send input to all sessions", adding new modes: 1) send to all panes
  in current tab, 2) to all sessions in current window, and 3) to an arbitrary
  collection of panes (toggled with context menu).
- You can toggle send input to all tabs/panes by re-pressing the keystroke that
  got you into that mode.
- Draw a dotted line around maximized sessions.
- Add support for multiple saved window arrangements.
- Add decimal <-> hex conversion to right-click context menu when a number is
  selected.

  pane with a particular profile.
- Allow pinch gesture to change font size.
- Make cmd-[ and cmd-] work when a pane is maximized.

  when you have a huge terminal, this makes it easy to quickly find a lost
  cursor. If activated with the shortcut cmd-/, continuing to hold cmd will keep
  the highlighting active.

- Add ability to split a pane by dragging a tab into a terminal session.
- Add "move session to split pane" option to context menu.

- Change mouse cursor to indicate that mouse reporting is on.
- Add cmd-shift-opt-T to open a new tab using the current session's profile.
- Change default global key bindings to cmd-shift-arrows to move tab left/right.
- Add menu item to move tab left/right.
- Add title bars to split panes that show the title. You can drag panes by
  their titles, and there is a menu and a close button in it as well.
- If no window is open, you can now select multiple items in the profiles and
  window and choose split horizontally/vertically to open a new window with the
  split.
- Add tab colors to view menu and tab context menu (thanks, andreax79)
- Add 'move session to window' context menu item.
- When closing a session, free its scrollback buffer in a background thread to
  avoid hanging.
- Alt-click moves the cursor to the click position.

- Add menu item to toggle broadcasting input to the current pane (make
  pane-by-pane toggling available to focus-follows-mouse users who couldn't
  open a context menu in a deselected pane)
- "Find" continues to search as new text appears.

System Integration
------------------
- In Mavericks, when system prefs are set such that multiple screens share one
  space, we only hide the dock and menu when a fullscreen iTerm2 window is on
  the first screen.
- Handle inserting emoji text in mavericks with cmd-ctrl-space.
- Make dock and menu bar appear by moving mouse to top/bottom of screen in
  non-Lion fullscreen mode. Remove hold-cmd-for-tabs.

- App bundle is now signed.
- When a file or folder is dragged onto the dock icon, open it in a new tab
  (not a new window).
- Retina graphics

Proprietary Escape Codes
------------------------
- Add escape code <Esc>]50;SetMark^G to perform Edit > Set Mark command.
- Add escape code to steal focus: ESC ]50;StealFocus^G  (thanks, gordolio).
- Add proprietary escape code esc]50;ClearScrollback^G to erase screen and
  scrollback buffer.
- Add proprietary escape code esc]50;CurrentDir=/Path/To/Directory^G to notify
  iTerm2 of the current directory (so you can cmd-click on relative filenames
  and we'll know where they are).
- Add proprietary escape code <esc>]50;SetProfile=X^G to set the current
  session's profile to the one named X.- Add proprietary escape code to send
  text to clipboard. To use, send esc]50;CopyToClipboard=X^G followed by text
  followed by esc]50;EndCopy^G, where X is a clipboard name from the set: ruler,
  find, font, or general. If not specified, general is used.
- Add esc]50;RequestAttention=x^G, where if x=1 the dock icon bounces and if
  x=0 it stops.

This release was built using XCode 15, which will
either make it work better in Sonoma or introduce
inexplicable bugs. Probably both, come to think of
it.

  menu as recent documents.
* Add Unicode 15 emoji.
* Use the running program's first letter as the
  tab icon if there is no built-in icon.

Bug fixes:
* Fix a memory corruption bug that caused a lot of
  crashes.
* Fix various crashes.
* Fix a memory leak.
* Update minimum contrast when dark mode changes.
* Support multi-line prompts when showing an
  offscreen command line at the top of the screen.
* Fix wrong underlines in offscreen command
  lines.
* Sanitize paths in x-man-page URLs.

Other improvements:
* Increase width of font picker panel to avoid
  truncation.
* Provide a more helpful error if a profile's
  command cannot be found.
* Strip control characters from RemoteHost.
* Warn before connecting via scp to a
  never-before-seen host.
* Add NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription so apps that
  use your photo library get a proper permission
  dialog.
* Don't close or clear composer when executing a
  command and auto composer is not enabled.
* Use more modern OpenAI APIs.
* Improve performance of window title setting.

- Add support for inline SVGs.
- Mouse reporting now supports horizontal
  scrolling and more mouse buttons.
- Add "Duplicate Session". It supports ssh
  integration, even with jump hosts!

  which is a sticky setting that lets you know
  when a command in a not-currently-visible
  session finishes. Requires shell integration.

- Fix a bug where images disappear prematurely.
- Remap modifiers on mouse clicks like we do for
  keypresses.
- Fix cursor color in reverse video mode. It
  should also be reversed.

New features
- There is a nascent SSH integration feature
  available for testing. Warning: it definitely
  has a lot of bugs. You can try it by setting the
  profile's command to SSH. The integration lets
  you export environment variables and copy files
  to the remote host. If Python 3.7 or later is
  available on the remote host, various features
  such as the Jobs status bar and toolbar
  components will reflect data from the remote
  rather than the local. There's also a
  barely-working feature that automatically mounts
  the remote host's filesystem as a cloud
  filesystem.
- There's a new control sequence for rich
  notifications:
[esc]1337;Notification=[params][control-G]
  Where params is a semicolon-delimited list of
  key value pairs:
  message=[text]
    The text to display.
  title=[text]
    Optional notification title.
  subtitle=[text]
    Optional notification subtitle.
  image=[data]
    Optional base64-encoded image.
- You can now remap the fn key if you have a
  MacBook.

Bug fixes
- Fix memory leaks.
- Fix a bug where combining marks sometimes didn't
  appear.
- Work around tmux's new limit on passthrough
  control sequences to fix copy to pasteboard in
  tmux integration.
- Fix file descriptor leak in pidinfo helper job.
- Fix a bug where varation selector 16 didn't work
  with code points outside the basic multilingual
  plane.
- Fix various crashes.
- Fix a bug in the shell integration installer
  where it assumed .bash_profile ends with a
  newline.
- Fix a discrepancy between GPU and non-GPU
  renderers for image drawing.
- Fix drawing of inline images when the machine's
  main display is non-Retina.
- Fix a bug where compact opaque windows with
  image backgrounds and 1 tab and no tabbar showed
  the image under the titlebar.
- Fix a bug where it2copy didn't work sometimes.
- Fix a bug in handling of zero-width spaces.
- Fix a bug where changing the type of scroller
  could cause a window to move away from a
  screen's edge.
- Fix bugs with zoomed panes in tmux integration
  causing the window to resize itself.
- The Open Quickly feature now includes terminal
  windows in search results.
- Fix bugs in the status bar layout algorithm that
  could create too-small components.
- Fix a bug where dragging from Fork, or other
  apps that treat dragging a file as dragging
  a link, that caused the drop to be rejected.
- FIx occasional hang affecting only beta and
  nightly build users.
- Fix a bug where shell integration injection
  didn't work for login shells.
- Don't show the secure keyboard input warning
  more than once per app launch.
- Fix copy with control sequences, which encoded
  SGR 0 and bright ANSI colors incorrectly.

Other improvements
- There are new key binding actions for Windows
  refugees who want to use Control-C and Control-V
  to copy and paste. "Copy or Send ^C" and "Paste
  or Send ^V" will copy (if there's a selection)
  or paste (if the clibpoard has text)
  and otherwise send the control character.
- Offer to replace an existing file when
  downloading.
- Improve readability of preferences search in
  dark mode.
- Support variation selector 16 except in
  alternate screen mode.
- Many improvements to the 1password integration.
- Many performance improvements.
- Improve appearance of status bar search field
  with non-default background colors.
- The font picker now supports stylistic
  alternatives.
- Miscellaneous visual improvements.
- In the next version of tmux you'll be able to
  mirror its paste buffer to the local clipboard.
- Fix memory leak when onscreen images are
  overwritten.
- Squelch audible beeps when focus reporting is
  the likely cause.

<pre id="changelist128617196615407000" style="display: none">New features
- Add "Render Selection", which replaces a chunk
  of selected text with a natively rendered view.
  For example, JSON gets pretty-printed and syntax
  highlighted. Rendered selections have the option
  of scrolling horizontally to make navigating
  logs easier. They are searchable. Over 150
  different languages are supported for syntax
  highlighting. Markdown gets special treatment
  and displays its rendered format.
- Enable logging as asciicast, which is playable
  by asciinema.
- Add option not to require a password to open the
  password manager.
- (Experimental) The password manager can now use
  LastPass or 1Password rather than the keychain.
  Use the (⋯) menu next to the search field to
  configure it.
- You can configure a shortcut to be a "leader".
  This allows you to define two-keystroke
  shortcuts, composed of leader + some other
  shortcut. For example, if you make cmd-B the
  leader then you can create a key binding for
  leader+h/j/k/l to navigate among split panes.
  In tmux integration, key bindings are
  automatically created to emulate tmux's
  shortcuts with the leader in place of tmux's
  prefix key.
  You can set up the leader in Prefs > Keys >
  Leader.
- The composer now supports search.
- The composer (cmd-shift-.) now supports multiple
  cursors. Use ctrl-shift-up/down or option-drag to
  create them. You can also convert search results
  to cursors with Edit > Find > Select Matches.
- You can resize the composer's height by dragging
  its bottom edge.
- Cmd-click in the composer opens the command in
  explainshell.com.
- In the composer, option-shift-enter sends the
  command at the cursor and removes it from the
  composer.
- Add "copy" as a new smart selection action.
- Option-cmd-click now selects the second smart
  selection action.
- Add a new kind of key binding action called
  "sequence" that performs any number of other key
  binding actions in order.
- Shell integration can now be injected
  automatically as part of creating a login shell.
  Explicit installation is no longer needed on
  localhost (except for tcsh users, who are still
  stuck in 1995. Sorry).
- Selecting URLs (cmd-opt-u) now enables shortcuts
  to jump to them by number.

Bug fixes
- Fix memory leak
- Fix a beachball in save panels.
- Fix a bug where errors were shown after an
  upload finished.
- Fix various crashes.
- When a session needs a Python API script to be
  running but it hasn't started yet, retry for
  five seconds.
- Fix a bug where prompt marks didn't show in the
  scrollbar.
- Fix rendering of background images in non-GPU
  renderer when togglign "separate background
  images per pane".
- Fix a bug where output on stderr could be lost.
- Fix a bug in rendering marks on non-retina
  displays.
- Fix a bug where split panes can't be dragged
  after moving them.
- Temporarily disable secure keyboard entry when
  exiting a hotkey window so the other app's
  window can be revealed.
- Tolerate errors in tmux.conf when starting tmux
  integration.
- Use x11 mouse reporting instead of SGR to fix
  curses support.
- Fix a bug where find could select the wrong
  range on new input.

Other improvements
- Set ITERM2_COOKIE in coprocesses so they can use
  the Python API without an extra authentication
  step. All other environment variables that
  sessions have are also now provided to
  coprocesses.
- Code points 0xf000-0xf003 can now be rendered.
  These are sometimes used in nerd fonts.
- GPU renderer is now usable when background
  images are shared across panes.
- Defer database janitorial work until after app
  launch to avoid blocking it.
- Performance improvements.
- If a session is short lived, uses a login shell,
  the shell does not exist, and the profile can be
  changed offer to change the shell to /bin/zsh
  which will always exist to get the user unstuck.
- A find indicator now display search results to
  highlight the current one with an animation.
- Saving prefs no longer clobbers symlinks.
- The list of displays in profile window settings
  now uses meaningful names for screens.
- Enable focus reporting in tmux integration.
- Copy mode now supports previous/next mark
  navigation.
- Add key binding actionss for next/previous pane.

- Input is now handled off the main thread. This
  increases throughput and decreases latency. We
  can now redraw at a higher frame rate without
  impacting throughput significantly.
- Selecting a bunch of text used to lock up the UI
  for a long time, but it is now instant. The hard
  work is deferred until you actually paste the
  text.
- Semantic history (cmd-clicking on a filename)
  used to search the filesystem on the main thread
  which could cause hangs (such as on slow network
  filesystems). This work has been moved to a
  separate XPC process, keeping the UI responsive
  while the search for files happens concurrently.
- Trigger evaluation, especially when you have
  many triggers, is significantly faster now.

New Features
- The P3 color space is now supported. The color
  picker uses P3 and control sequences that accept
  a color space now accept p3.
- Add a setting to preserve windows' spaces on
  restoration.
- Searches for profiles now allow you to exclude
  terms using the minus operator. For example:
  -tag:dynamic
- Clipboard content reporting via control sequence
  OSC 52 is now supported, but requires user
  consent to enable.

Other Improvements
- Allow apps running in the terminal to request
  bluetooth access.
- Optimize bandwidth for sending keystrokes to
  tmux in tmux integratino mode.
- Ensure the URL preview box does not overlap the
  hyperlink being previewed.
- Search history completion now works on words
  instead of entire phrases.
- Avoid causing the window contents to jump when
  colors change.
- Visual improvements to minimal theme with
  transparent windows.
- Add support for newest Emoji.
- UI improvements to the password manager for
  adding a new password.
- Tweak how command history is sorted. When there
  is no search query, use a purely chronological
  ordering.
- Tweak status bar colors to look nicer in the
  Minimal theme.
- Data injected by the Python API during a silent
  coprocess is now made visible.
- Add support for the Nova editor to semantic
  history.
- Tweak the status icon (shown in the menu bar
  when you've excluded iTerm2 from the dock) to
  have a more modern design.
- Right-clicking on a number in scientific
  notation like 6.022e23 shows its expanded form
  in the context menu.
- imgcat has a bunch of new options. You'll need
  to reinstall shell integration utilities to get
  it.
- You can now search the tty and foreground job
  process ID in the Open Quickly window.

Bug Fixes
- Ensure Rosetta is installed before running the
  Python API.
- Fix a bug where clicking the dock icon while the
  tip of the day was open wouldn't open a new
  window.
- Fix bugs in positioning the badge, indicators,
  and broadcast stripes when a per-pane status bar
  or per-pane title bar is present.
- Fix a bug where fullscreen windows overlapped
  the notch when the menu bar was not
  automatically hidden in fullscreen.
- Fix a bug where fullscreen windows resized
  incorrectly when changing the active display in
  the presence of a notch.
- Fix a bug where the Jobs toolbelt would show a
  process with pid 0 after the login shell
  terminates.
- Fix bugs in handling newlines in control
  sequences that set the title.
- Fix a bug where marks were sometimes not removed
  when the screen was cleared.
- Fix memory leaks.
- Fix a long-standing memory corruption bug.
- Fix a bug where marks were drawn upside-down
  in the GPU renderer.
- Fix a bug where faint text could render
  incorrectly.
- Fix a bug where window transparency could be
  wrong when the window is first created.
- Fix overlapping search results with regular
  expression queries.
- Fix a bug where "clear to last mark" misbehaved
  while at a prompt. It now clears to the mark
  before the current prompt.
- Improve appearance of tabs being dragged.
- Select Current Command now selects past the
  cursor if needed.
- Fix a bug where crash reports weren't sent on
  macOS 12.

  know if programs start misbehaving.

  patch level 2500. This unlocks features in some
  apps (like better key handling in Emacs) but
  will probably break things I don't know exist.

New Features:
- Add preference to allow/disallow apps changing
  the function of the option keys with a control
  sequence.
- Add a menu item to pop the current session into
  a new window.
- The git status bar now indicates the repo state
  (merging, reverting, cherrypicking, bisecting,
  rebasing, or applying).
- When you right click on a hex color like #ffeedd
  show a preview of the color in sRGB in the
  context menu.
- Add a new type of trigger to highlight the whole
  line. This is useful because matching .*foo.* is
  very slow. With this trigger you can simply
  match foo and the whole line changes color.

Improvements
- The git status bar component no longer shells
  out to the system git. It uses libgit2 instead
  (nicely named!) and should be faster and more
  reliable now.
- When known, the current git branch is used as a
  search feature in Open Quickly.
- Don't show a line between the titlebar and
  tabbar in Big Sur.
- Increase max allowed blur on macOS 10.14.
- When you move a window to a different screen by
  selecting the Move To Screen menu item, it will
  lose its affinity for the window assigned to it
  in Prefs > Profiles > Window and stay where it
  was put when screens are added or removed.
- Buttons in modal alerts now accept cmd+letter
  shortcuts.
- Ignore dynamic profiles whose filename ends in a
  tilde.
- Reset terminal when relaunching a session (e.g.,
  paste bracketing and mouse reporting).
- The composer window now uses the terminal's
  font.
- Scrolling with the trackpad should be more
  responsive now.
- Change how text is drawn when not using GPU
  renderer to avoid artifacts.
- When doing selection respecting soft boundaries,
  treat a backslash in the last column as a
  continuation mark and don't include it.
- By default, save terminal contents to history
  when there is a scrolling region that touches
  the top of the screen.
- Newly saved window arrangements will restore to
  the right size when scroller style changes after
  they were created (unless there are side-by-side
  split panes).
- Treat soft hyphens as unicode punctuation in
  Advanced Paste.

Bug Fixes
- Fix a bug where doublecliking on a session
  titlebar didn't maximize tmux panes correctly.
- Fix clipped button next to status bar search
  field.
- Blur is now correct after changing window type
  or theme.
- Fix a bug where a window forgot it was blurred
  when toggling traditional fullscreen in Minimal
  theme.

  wrong desktop.

  "off" when the "Reduce motion" accessibility
  setting is enabled and a window is maximized.

  sent the wrong code.
- Fix a bug where the app could hang after certain
  trackpad touches.
- Fix a bug where copy on selection didn't always
  work.
- Fix a bug where transparent windows changed
  colors in native full screen mode.
- Fix a bug where keystrokes bound to menu items
  didn't always work.
- Fix crashes.
- Fix a bug where disabling
  middle-click-to-close-a-tab also breaks the tab
  close button.
- Fix keystroke filtering in the Python APi which
  seems have been broken for some time.
- Fix various bugs with HTML tab titles: remove
  HTML for window title and tooltips.
- Fix a bug where inline images downscaled
  with artifacts in the GPU renderer.
- Fix a crash on launch if ~/.config/iterm2 is not
  able to be created and is not already a
  directory.
- Fix a bug where tab icons were flipped
  vertically on macOS 10.14.
- Fix a bug where the GPU renderer would sometimes
  use the wrong thickness for text.

Annoying things I'm sorry about
- You'll be asked to re-install the Python
  runtime. This fixes a problem where pip3 would
  sometimes fail. Instead of creating a symlink
  of ~/Library/ApplicationSupport we will now use
  ~/.config/iterm2/AppSupport.

New Features
- Tab titles now parse very basic HTML tags for
  bold, italic, and underline. Less-than and
  ampersand entites are also recognized.
- Margins are now adjustable in Prefs >
  Appearance > Panes.
- Add an option to save prefs to a custom folder
  automatically.

Improvements
- Improve performance of opening lots of tabs at
  once.
- Improve performance when changing prefs that
  affect many tabs.
- Tabs are now selected on mouse down rather than
  on mouse up.
- Hide tab close button on small tabs to prevent
  accidental closure.
- Confirm deleting entries in the password
  manager.
- Tab icons are now always left aligned and get
  replaced with the close button on hover.
- Plain-text logs now include timestamps.
- Recognize U+251C and U+2524 as column dividers
  for selection's soft boundaries.
- Reduce minimum dimming amount allowed in Prefs >
  Appearance > Dimming.
- Use terminal background color to determine
  appearance of composer.
- You can now use Cmd-W to dismiss the composer.
- Don't show an alert if the initial tmux
  integration command fails.
- When you split a pane in tmux integration and
  focus follows mouse is on, don't make the pane
  under the mouse active. Make the new pane
  active.
- New tmux windows created outside iTerm2 (e.g.,
  by running `tmux new-window`) will become tabs
  in the current window.
- Give backpressure to commands run in the
  background (e.g., from triggers) to keep them
  from hogging CPU.
- Improve performance of creating a new session in
  a custom directory.
- Improve performance when there are big
  background images.
- The composer now clears the existing command by
  sending C-U C-K.
- Handle "Default_Ignorable" unicode characters
  correctly.
- Use the background color of inactive sessions to
  determine the split pane divider color.
- Improve performance of decoding inline images.
- Make trackpads scroll faster to act more like
  other macOS apps.

Bug Fixes
- Fix various crashes.
- Fix a bug where tab labels would be white in
  light mode when there was a colored tab.
- Fix alignment of underlines in GPU renderer.
- Fix various drawing bugs in legacy renderer.
- Fix a bug where on Big Sur transparency doesn't
  work with background images.
- Fix $$$$ in profile commands, which should be
  replaced with $$.
- Fix a bug in key reporting for arrow keys when
  application cursor mode is on. This caused
  problems in vim.
- Improve how background colors are blended with
  background images in GPU renderer to be
  consistent with legacy renderer.
- Fix a bug where Window > Move to (display) was
  disabled.
- Fix a bug where tmux panes would get killed when
  switching sessions.
- Don't show the "short-lived session" warning in
  tmux integration when creating a new tmux
  session.
- Fix a problem where BBEdit couldn't find the
  parent iTerm2 app.
- Tolerate missing profiles when restoring a
  window arrangement.
- Don't show swipe-between-tabs animation when
  there is only one tab.
- Give minimal windows an invisible proxy icon so
  that accessibility can tell what the current
  directory is.
- Tmux integration windows enter full screen when
  the profile specifies it.
- Fix a bug where windows were not movable after
  exiting full screen.
- Fix various bugs in the "Add Trigger" menu item.
- Fix bugs where switching tabs makes a cleared
  search field regain its previous value.
- Fix a bug where async_get_full_profile in Python
  API would throw for some profiles.
- Reduce size of saved state database.
- Fix a bug where tmux integration didn't work on
  OpenBSD.
- Fix a bug where clicking in the search field
  didn't work.
- Fix a bug where non-default background colors
  had the wrong opacity in the GPU renderer.

  upon attach when it oughtn't.


3.4.0 Release Notes:

Breaking Changes
- TIOCGWINSZ now reports pixels, not points.
  This makes it easier to make inline images
  pixel-perfect.

  the Python runtime. This confers security
  benefits.

- There is a new profile preference to configure
  whether mouse reporting of clicks and drags are
  allowed.

  between tabs, like in Safari.
- Curly underlines are now supported.
- Adds support for DECRQSS.
- DECSCUSR 0 now resets the cursor to its default
  setting.
- Adds support for flow control in tmux 3.2 and
  "pause mode" that will automatically pause
  sessions in tmux integration that get very far
  behind with the ability to catch up quickly.
  NOTE: tmux 3.2 has not yet been released.
- tmux integration windows will now keep their
  size the same as you create or destroy split
  panes.
- Adds a preference to exclude iTerm2 from the
  dock and cmd-tab app switcher only if all
  windows are hotkey windows.
- In the Minimal and Compact themes, you can now
  drag the window by grabbing the edge of the tab
  bar near the window border.

  selection now enters Copy Mode automatically.
  This can be disabled in Prefs > General >
  Selection.

  maximized, no title bar, etc.) for existing
  windows from the Window menu.
- There is a new control sequence to clear
  captured output (OSC 1337 ; ClearCapturedOutput

- The ApplicationSupport symlink under ~/Library
  is no longer needed.
- Various performance improvements.

  The security model has also changed: apps can
  authenticate via Applescript or you can choose
  to allow all programs running locally to use the
  API.
- Use a single daemon process for all sessions
  instead of one per session. This reduces the
  number of process IDs used and also improves the
  time to launch a new session.
- Background images are significantly faster when
  not using the GPU renderer.
- Most tables now allow multiple selection.
- The number of search results is now shown in the
  Find on Page UI.

  app to iTerm2 (e.g., with cmd-tab).
- Support u= or username= TXT records in Bonjour
  to provide a user name.
- You can press cmd-B to toggle broadcasting in
  the password manager.

  (such as those made with Edit Session) will now
  pick up changes to the original profile.
- Fix a bug where inline images and OSC 8
  hyperlinks didn't get restored reliably when
  restarting the app.
- Improve support for zero-width joiners in Emoji.

  NOTE: tmux 3.2 has not yet been released.
- tmux integration windows will now keep their
  size the same as you create or destroy split
  panes.
- Adds a preference to exclude iTerm2 from the
  dock and cmd-tab app switcher only if all
  windows are hotkey windows.
- In the Minimal and Compact themes, you can now
  drag the window by grabbing the edge of the tab
  bar near the window border.
- Pressing shift+arrow key when there is a
  selection now enters Copy Mode automatically.
  This can be disabled in Prefs > General >
  Selection.
- You can now change window style (top of screen,
  maximized, no title bar, etc.) for existing
  windows from the Window menu.
- There is a new control sequence to clear
  captured output (OSC 1337 ; ClearCapturedOutput
  ST).
- After editing a session's name in Edit Session,
  control sequences will no longer change it.
  There is a lock icon in Edit Session to change
  this behavior.

  default.

Improvements
- Updates now use exclusively EdDSA. DSA-signed
  auto update appcasts are completely gone.
- The ApplicationSupport symlink under ~/Library
  is no longer needed.

  instead of a TCP socket for better performance.
  The security model has also changed: apps can
  authenticate via Applescript or you can choose
  to allow all programs running locally to use the
  API.
- Use a single daemon process for all sessions
  instead of one per session. This reduces the
  number of process IDs used and also improves the
  time to launch a new session.
- Background images are significantly faster when
  not using the GPU renderer.
- Most tables now allow multiple selection.
- The number of search results is now shown in the
  Find on Page UI.
- Dynamic profiles now works with symlinks. Even
  the DynamicProfiles folder itself may be a
  symlink.
- Exported scripts now have a more secure
  container format that signs the entire file
  except the signature itself.
- Improve cold launch time.
- Countless minor improvements and polishing.
- Big Sur supported.
- Permission is now requested before various
  possibly destructive or annoying activities are
  done in response to control sequences.
- Don't snap window size to the cell grid when it
  gets resized by an Accessibility API.
- Only use touch bar mitigations for keypresses
  originating from the built-in keyboard.
- The profile preference "Send text at start" is
  now an interpolated string.
- The profile preference "Custom command" is
  now an interpolated string.
- The feature where the scroll wheel sends arrow
  keys when in alternate screen mode now works
  even when alternate screen mode is disabled.
- Enable window shadow for transparent windows.
- When resizing the window while scrolled up in to
  history, keep the text in the top left locked in
  position.
- Show a brief message when automatic profile
  switching takes effect.
- Postgres icon added.
- Status bar components that show graphs (CPU,
  memory, network, battery) now animate smoothly
  and use much less CPU.
- Inline images no longer scale unnecessarily.
- You'll be offered to repair saved arrangements
  with bad initial working directories.
- Add support for SSH_AUTH_SOCK with the built-in
  secure copy feature.
- You can now change a profile's icon by single
  clicking on the image.
- Don't disable metal when a window is obscured to
  improve performance when switching from another
  app to iTerm2 (e.g., with cmd-tab).
- Support u= or username= TXT records in Bonjour
  to provide a user name.
- You can press cmd-B to toggle broadcasting in
  the password manager.
- Improve error reporting for dynamic profiles.
- If a "run command" from a trigger produces too
  many errors, rate limit them to avoid spamming
  you.
- Performance improvements
- Add min/max width configuration settings to most
  status bar components.

Bug Fixes
- Full screen windows in the Minimal or Compact
  theme did not used to get restored properly and
  now they do.
- Fix how 24-bit colors are reported to work with
  vim.
- Saved arrangements that contain local changes
  (such as those made with Edit Session) will now
  pick up changes to the original profile.
- Fix a bug where inline images and OSC 8
  hyperlinks didn't get restored reliably when
  restarting the app.
- Improve support for zero-width joiners in Emoji.
- Fix a memory leak of inline images when
  restoring windows after restarting the app.
- Shortcuts bound to Paste won't take effect when
  the find-on-page text field has focus.
- Fix a hang on certain Sixel images.
- URL escaping should be more consistent now in
  various places (search web for selection, open
  URL, etc.)
- Fix a bug where tmux windows shrink each time
  you attach.
- Fix a bug where a key bound to Ignore would not
  prevent a menu shortcut from working.
- Change how escaping works so you do not need to
  escape backslashes in profile initial text or
  command.

* Add control as a shortcut for navigation.
* Add checkbox to advanced prefs to exclude
  default values.
* Window state restoration is now completely
  custom. It uses a sqlite database to update
  changes instead of rewriting the whole thing
  over and over. It should be faster and more
  reliable now.

Improvements:
* You can now provide custom session icons by
  placing graphic_colors.json, graphic_icons.json,
  and graphic_xxx.png in
  ~/Library/Application Support/iTerm2.
* Enable secure keyboard input at password prompt.
* When you create a hotkey window with
  Prefs>Keys>Hotkey>Create a Dedicated Hotkey
  Window, add a keybinding to the new profile for
  cmd-t to open a new tab with that profile.
* Dismiss paste bracketing warning when a control
  sequence changes its setting.
* Remove deviations from CSI u spec.

Bug Fixes:
* Fix crashes.
* Fix a bug where a split pane could become less
  than 2 columns wide, and then crazy things
  happen.
* Fix various bugs in CSI u mode, including f1-f4
  not working in vim.
* Don't let momentum scroll in one tab affect
  another when the mouse cursor moves.
* Fix a bug where the window didn't get shorter
  when closing the last tab.
* Don't auto-enter copy mode unless there is a
  selection.
* Save and restore touch bar key labels that were
  changed by a control sequence.
* Various visual improvements.

3.4.0 Release Notes:

New Features
- You can now set a custom tab title on a profile
- There is a new profile preference to configure
  whether mouse reporting of clicks and drags are
  allowed.
- Search results, marks, and annotations are now
  indicated in the scroll bar.
- There's a new preference to focus a window when
  you right- or middle-click in it.
- Add support for IntelliJ IDEA, VSCodium, and
  Sublime Text 4 as Semantic History editors.
- There's a new "Composer" feature that lets you
  quickly open a scratchpad to enter a command.

- DECSCUSR 0 now resets the cursor to its default
  setting.
- Adds support for flow control in tmux 3.2 and
  "pause mode" that will automatically pause
  sessions in tmux integration that get very far
  behind with the ability to catch up quickly.
  NOTE: tmux 3.2 has not yet been released.
- tmux integration windows will now keep their
  size the same as you create or destroy split

  The security model has also changed: apps can
  authenticate via Applescript or you can choose
  to allow all programs running locally to use the
  API.

- The number of search results is now shown in the
  Find on Page UI.

  originating from the built-in keyboard.
- The profile preference "Send text at start" is
  now an interpolated string.
- The profile preference "Custom command" is
  now an interpolated string.
- The feature where the scroll wheel sends arrow
  keys when in alternate screen mode now works
  even when alternate screen mode is disabled.
- Enable window shadow for transparent windows.
- When resizing the window while scrolled up in to
  history, keep the text in the top left locked in
  position.
- Show a brief message when automatic profile
  switching takes effect.

Bug Fixes
- Full screen windows in the Minimal or Compact
  theme did not used to get restored properly and
  now they do.
- Fix how 24-bit colors are reported to work with
  vim.
- Saved arrangements that contain local changes
  (such as those made with Edit Session) will now
  pick up changes to the original profile.
- Fix a bug where inline images and OSC 8
  hyperlinks didn't get restored reliably when
  restarting the app.
- Improve support for zero-width joiners in Emoji.

This is a bugfix release for 3.3.10, which was
short-lived. The release notes for 3.3.10 are
included below.

- Fixes a bug introduced in 3.3.10 where the dock
  and menu bar would sometimes remain hidden after
  exiting non-native fullscreen.
- Works around a possible macOS bug where Metal
  drops frames occasionally.

3.3.10

Security Improvements
- Improves the method for gaining authorization
  to run Python scripts launched from outside
  iTerm2.

  Version 3.3.9 deprecated the older auth
  mechanism based on the command line, requiring
  the user to consent to every connection. That
  was annoying.

  There are now two ways to get permission:

  1. The UI prompts on every connection.
  2. The app requests a cookie using Applescript.
     Therefore, Applescript permission is
     required. This requires the user to
     consent only once per app that originates the
     connection.

  Note that this does not affect scripts launched
  by iTerm2, such as those opened from the Scripts
  menu.

  For more information, including details on how
  to use osascript to get a cookie, please see:
  https://iterm2.com/python-api-security-model

New Features:

  internet-free install option.

  Python scripts so they can use TLS.

  it a soothing blue color.

  more. Calls to proc_pidinfo are now made in an
  XPC server.

  since it is now visible against a black
  background.

Security Improvements
- The security model for the Python API has changed. Any
  process attempting to use the API that was not launched by
  iTerm2 will require explicit user approval.

  The previous technique, which relied on inferring the job
  name from its command line, could be subverted.

  Consequently, the UI for authorizing particular scripts
  has been removed.

  For more information, please see
  https://iterm2.com/python-api-security-model

This build fixes a serious security issue. All
users should upgrade.

The Mozilla Foundation has generously sponsored a
security audit of the iTerm2 source code. As part
of this audit, a problem was discovered which
could cause iTerm2 to issue commands in response
to receiving certain input. This is a serious
security issue because in some circumstances it
could allow an attacker to execute commands on
your machine when you view a file or otherwise
receive input they have crafted in iTerm2.

For more information, please visit the
iterm2-discuss group.

New Features

Other Improvements
- Simplify themes. Before, you could choose to use
  the Minimal theme with the Normal window style,
  but it looked terrible. Minimal looks good with
  the Compact window style. Users were also
  confused because the theme and window style are
  tightly coupled visually but distant in prefs.
  In this version, the compact window style is
  gone. By selecting the Minimal theme, Normal
  windows are automatically compact. The
  "Automatic" theme has been renamed to "Regular",
  and in this theme the Normal window style has a
  title bar. A new theme, "Compact" has been added
  which does away with the title bar but otherwise
  looks more like a standard macOS app than does
  Minimal.
- Prevent repeated Print control sequences from
  locking up a session.
- Do not draw the area left of the first tab as
  part of the first tab.
- In minimal or compact theme, when the tabbar is
  on top or bottom and tabs stretch to fit width
  and you have one tab and you drag the tab and
  drop it outside any window, move the window
  instead of destroying the old one and creating a
  new one at the new location, which had the
  annoying side-effect of forgetting the Use
  Transparency setting.
- Allow fractional point sizes with new font
  picker.
- When restoring a window from an arrangement, try
  to put windows fully on-screen. This is useful
  if you have changed your displays since saving
  the arrangement.

Bug Fixes
- Fixes a problem on macOS 10.12 where sessions
  would terminate immediately after opening.
- Preserve both the prompt and a partially entered
  command when clearing the screen.
- Fix a bug where a window's title bar could
  become transparent.
- Fix a bug where the title bar could have the
  wrong color.
- Fixes a bug where the full screen tab bar could
  be inset on the left.
- Fixes crash on cmd-click to invoke smart
  selection action.
- Fixes various crashes.
- Fix a bug where advanced initial working
  directory prefs had the wrong defaults.
- Fix a bug where using a session immediately
  after creating it in AppleScript would have no
  effect.

  they may now span split panes and you can adjust
  how they are scaled to avoid stretching.
- Add support for reporting keystrokes with CSI u.
- New type of trigger added that turns text into a
  hyperlink.
- New type of trigger added that adds annotations
  to the matching text.

- Replace the system font picker with an easier to

  history.

Bug Fixes
- Fix a bug where the tabbar would overlap content
  in native fullscreen for minimal+compact windows
  when adding a second tab while in fullscreen.
- Fix a bug where double tap to open a hotkey
  window didn't function when secure keyboard
  entry was enabled.
- Fix prefs search UI in macOS 10.12 and 10.13.
- Fix a bug when tab dragging is disabled that it
  would still appear to work.
- Remember the next/previous pane navigation order
  of sessions when maximizing/unmaximizing.
- Fix a bug where the app would quit when there's
  only one window and you toggle it to non-native
  fullscreen and confirm to quit is disabled.I
- Fix a bug where the shell was incorrectly
  included as a running process when deciding
  whether you should be prompted to close a
  session.
- Fix a bug where URLs were not properly passed as
  \1 to semantic history commands.

  provides to wrap Python was not correctly
  identified as a Python executable, which caused

  selecting the terminal language.
- Fix a bug when switching to a minimized pane

- Ensure minimized sessions do not resize while
  dragging a pane.
- Fix a bug where annotations were not visible
  with the GPU renderer enabled.
- Fix a bug where two concurrent downloads of the
  same file name would step on each other.

Other improvements:
- Clear the bell icon when the session becomes
  active, rather than waiting until a key is
  pressed.
- Add a warning not to use Pragmata Pro
  non-antialiased.
- Remember the toolbelt width and tool heights
  more reliably.
- Improve legibility of non-selected tab text
  color when at least one tab has a tab color.

- Fix a crash on first launch when Safari hasn't 
  been run yet.

- When you drag a session over a tab with a 
  maximized pane, don't cause any panes to get 
  SIGWINCH.

- Change how the secure keyboard input menu item 
  works: Selecting it now toggles whether iTerm2 
  *wants* secure keyboard entry to be on. Before,
  it would consider whether other apps had it on,
  which was just confusing. Now it shows a 
  checkmark when it is on because iTerm2 wants it
  on, a hyphen when iTerm2 wants it off but it is
  on anyway, and no mark when it is actually off.

- Fix support for subpixel antialiasing on Mojave.
  Previously, if you had enabled this hidden OS
  feature, text would be very hard to read.
- Improve the appearance of translucent tmux
  integration windows on Mojave.
- Change how "thin strokes" works on Mojave. The
  concept only applies to subpixel antialiasing.
  You can either choose to turn on subpixel
  antialiasing (and adjust stroke thickness) or
  leave it off and live without.
- Fix a bug where left/right-of-screen hotkey
  windows floating over another app's full screen
  window did not go all the way to the top of the
  screen.
- Add usage descriptions so programs running
  within iTerm2 that use the camera, contacts,
  location, the microphone, or contacts can
  request permission to do so.

Other improvements:
-------------------
- Expose English keyboard emulation setting in
  Prefs>Keys. If switching panes/tabs/windows by
  pressing modifier+number stopped working and you
  have a non-English keyboard, go flip the switch
  there.

<pre id="changelist190225241338299746" style="display: none">The big new feature in iTerm2 version 3.2 is a new rendering
engine that uses Metal 2. It provides much higher drawing
performance. Its availability is subject to some
configuration settings. For details, see
https://gitlab.com/gnachman/iterm2/wikis/Metal-Renderer.

New Features
- Metal renderer
- New advanced pref: Open a new window when you click the
  dock icon and no windows are already open?
- New advanced pref: When Focus Follows Mouse is enabled,
  activate the window under the cursor when iTerm2 becomes
  active?
- New advanced pref: Underline Semantic History-selectable
  items under the cursor while holding cmd?
- You can now escape $$ in an Applescript profile command
  with $$$$
- New advanced pref (affecting semantic history's URL
  detection): URLs must contain a scheme?
- Show inline images in retina resolution. On by default in
  beta. In release, enable advanced pref "Show inline images
  at Retina resolution".
- There is a new key binding action to toggle mouse
  reporting.
- Semantic history now recognizes visual studio code-style
  "filename[line, column]" references.
- There's a new type of trigger that turns text into a
   hyperlink.

Bug Fixes
- When you drag a session onto itself in a window with split
  panes, do not move the window.
- Don't allow fullscreen or edge-attached windows to be
  moved with cmd-opt-shift-drag.
- Fix the color picker's eyedropper feature to respect color
  spaces.
- If multiple hotkey windows are open, do not return to the
  previously active app when one is closed.
- When changing the number of lines of scrollback, do not
  apply the change until focus leaves the text field. This
  solves a problem where erasing the value would erase your
  history.
- Scrolling with wheel mice is no longer oversensitive.
- Change behavior of prompt-before-closing for tmux
  integration. Since the list of jobs is not visible, always
  prompt when a whitelist of jobs is specified.
- Fix a bug where changing the cursor shape by escape
  sequence could be reverted by changing any profile
  property.
- When the password manager fails to get a password because
  the system Keychain denied access, show an alert
  explaining what happened.
- Ignore modifier+number when there's no matching
  pane/tab/window to switch to rather than passing it to the
  terminal as a keypress.
- Fix a bug where cmd-0 did not restore the original font
  size in tmux integration.
- Ignore malformed OSC 11.
- Fixes a bug where images could be drawn in the wrong
  column.
- Improved behavior of Yen key sending backslash for
  Japanese keyboards.
- "Select Current Command" works while the command
   is running
- Fix a bug where the offer to turn off paste bracketing
  didn't actually turn off paste bracketing.

Other improvements
- When not in alternate screen mode, tab will change the
  background color of cells the cursor skipped over. This
  violates tradition but is more sensible behavior for
  printing syntax-highlighted code with tabs.
- Inset marks by one pixel on the left margin.
- The rendering of faint text has been changed to take the
  background color into account.
- The toolbelt tools look nicer in the dark schemes.
- The pointing hand cursor will show only while over a
  clickable item while holding cmd.
- Tab name truncation no longer takes a parenthesized (job)
  name at the end into account when deciding whether to
  truncate the head or tail.
- Performance improvements.

- When you duplicate a profile with a hotkey window, make the
  duplicate profile not have a hotkey.
- Reject more false 3-finger taps.
- Respect 'open tmux windows as tabs in existing window' for windows
  created at the command line with 'tmux new-window'.
- Fix a bug where unburying a session could cause it to come back with
  the wrong window type. Fixes a similar bug with undo-close.

- The setting "Open tmux windows as tabs in existing
  window" no longer applies to new tmux integration
  windows you create after attaching. The old behavior
  prevented you from creating unattached windows in tmux
  integration mode.

Bug Fixes:
- Fix a bug that caused iTerm2 to hang when using the
  Metal renderer
- Fix a few crashes
- Temporarily disable the Metal renderer while a view is
  being resized to avoid seeing it stretched.
- Fix support for double-struck bold text in the Metal
  renderer.
- Fix a bug where new windows would draw incorrectly
  sometimes when using the Metal renderer.
- Turn off Metal renderer when Find or Paste views are
  open because they don't always composite correctly.

New Features:
- Add an advanced setting to disable wraparound in
  directional split pane navigation.
- Add an advanced setting that allows TAB codes to wrap
  around to the next line. This is useful to preserve
  tabs for text you plan to paste but could break
  backward compatibility.
- Add an advanced pref to disable middle click closes
  tab.

  a left-side tab bar that's limited by the 1/3 * content
  size bound will have fewer columns than it should.

- When opening a new window when the app isn't active, such
  as with Applescript, wait for the app to become active
  before making the new window key.

  or focus reporting when we transition from no hostname to
  having a hostname. Fixes a problem with fish.
- Disable paste bracketing for uploads.
- Don't save uploads to paste history.

  floating panel, and the app is excluded from the dock and
  menu bar
- Fix a bug where function keys on the touch bar could not
  be used as shortcuts in Prefs>Keys.
- Don't unmaximize a tab when switching to the maximized
  session from Open Quickly.

<pre id="changelist2765807942587178868" style="display: none">Bug fixes:
- If you press Fn+Ctrl+Key send Ctrl+Key, not Key. A strange
  behavior dating back to the old iTerm.
- Fixes some crashes, including a very frequent crash caused
  by a bad interaction between Sparkle and user defaults.
- Prevent high sierra tabs the "right" way, by overriding a
  method in NSWindow, rather than just setting a user
  default.
- The tab control character no longer changes the background
  color of cells it skips over.
- Don't send two newlines when you launch iTerm2 with a
  shell script (e.g., by double clicking one in Finder)
- Show Services in the context menu when more than one line
  of text is selected (up to 10k lines).

New features:
- When excluded from dock and app switcher, add Check for
  Updates to status icon in menu bar.
- Adds an advanced preference to change how line height is
  calculated, which improves results for Input Mono
  Condensed and acts more like Terminal.app.
- When at a password prompt and the key icon is showing,
  you can now click the key icon to open the password
  manager.

Other changes:
- Improve language in prefs dialog to make it clear when
  you're getting beta vs release builds on autoupdate.

- Add a new touch bar button that reports status. Use it2setkeylabel set
  status "message". You could use it to show the current git branch in
  the touch bar. Pressing the button takes you to where the status was
  set.

Bug fixes:
- Fix a bug where the screen jumped around when scrolling by dragging
  the scroller.
- Improve how network automounts are detected. This helps us avoid
  stat()ing files on the network, which can cause hangs when semantic
  history tries to discover if a file exsts.
- Improve performance for moving line-by-line through a file by caching
  CTLineRef's.
- Keep process monitoring from eating too much CPU.
- Validate secure copy hostname and user name to ensure legal characters
  only are present.
- Fix a crash when the font is broken and reports a 0 size.
- When new search results appear after the find on page query is entered
  allow them to be navigated to with find next/previous.
- Fix a bug where non-shell integration users could not reuse the
  current directory.
- Force everyone to upgrade to new shell integration version because of
  a security issue.
- Allow the password manager to open even if another sheet is already
  open.
- Draw the default background color behind inline images.
- Fix a bug where the "Edit password" button in the password manager
  would change your password into dots.
- Fix ligatures in Iosevka.
- Fix a bug where the wrong job name would be shown in the titlebar when
  there were two jobs that considered themselves foreground jobs.
- Fix a bug where the order of windows in applescript was random, not
  back to front.

<pre id="changelist3316109365491090892" style="display: none">New features:
- Add support for OSC 8 to do hypertext links. The syntax is:
  OSC 8 ; params ; url ST
    params is zero or more colon-delimited key=value strings. The only
  defined key is "id". Two adjacent hyperlinks with the same URL but
  different "id"s will not highlight together on hover. id is
  optional.
    As usual, OSC is 'esc ]' and st is 'esc \'.
- Trigger highlighting colors in a dynamic profile may use #rrggbb
  notation.
- Semantic history can now open file:line:column in VSCode.
- Change "Open in current space" for hotkey windows to move the hotkey
  window to the current space if it's already open on another space
  when the hotkey is pressed.
- Add an advanced pref to tweak the height of the underline cursor.
- Add an experimental feature to draw an outline around underline and
  vertical bar cursors to improve distinction from text.

Bug fixes:
- Add a send text request to the experimental API server
- Add an advanced pref to use full-height cursor (including vertical
  padding area)
- Draw underline and vertical line cursor behind text to
  improve readability.
- Update to Sparkle 1.17 (with iTerm2-specific patches)
- The first time the tmux gateway is auto-buried, open the
  sessions menu and point out how to restore it with a popover hanging
  off an invisible high-level window.
- Prevent marks from getting absurdly wide when margins are
  increased well beyond their defaults.
- Add a clear button to captured output tool.
- Fix a truly terrible memory leak.
- Fix a bug where double-tap of a modifier didn't work to open a
  hotkey window if it didn't also have a regular shortcut.
- Fix a leak of inline images.
- Fix a bug where sessions aren't restored correctly if the number of
  scrollback lines is small.
- Fix a bug where the find cursor UI would not be removed if you
  switched sessions while it was open.
- Improve performance in neovim by ensuring the display updates more
  regularly.
- Give scrollers a light appearance when the window has a dark
  appearance so they'll be visible.
- There's a hack to make the app active when the space changes
  to a lion fullscreen window and the app isn't active. This is needed
  only for LSUIElement apps, where the OS gets confused. Limit the
  hack to LSUIElement mode since you could use spaces and have two
  monitors.
- Use SRGB for OSC 6 ; 1 ; bg ; red ; brightness ; Pc ST. It
  was unstable before because I'd set the value in calibrated and then
  convert it to SRGB when modifying a different component.
- 6f9ab24 Don't crash on OSC 7 with bad URL.
- Fix a bug where we incorrectly removed the tab color from
  non-tmux sessions. It should have removed the tab color from tmux
  sessions that have one in the tmux profile but not in the saved
  session state.
- Handle ligatures in Firacode better if had previously turned off
  ligatures in a different ligature font.

  is already opened.
- Fix a bug where a color preset couldn't be imported by opening an .itermcolors
  file prior to opening the preferences panel.

  profile over the current one even when the current one outscores it.
- Change how paths in automatic profiless pare matched. Now, /foo/bar/* will
  match a path of /foo/bar. Before, it would only match /foo/bar/something. The

Lots of bug fixes and some teeny new features. Release notes now include the
SHA-256 of the zip file. This is a follow up to the short-lived version
2.9.20160422, which had some crashing bugs.

- Fix two crashes that happened frequently in versions of OS X 10.10 and older
  (failure to remove an observer and use of a 10.11 API)

The following changes were also in 2.9.20160422:

Updates:
- Update libssh to version 1.7 to fix a crash when public key authentication
  fails.
- Update to the latest version of Sparkle, version 1.14.

Major bug fixes:
- Fix a memory leak.
- Fix a crash when changing the number of displays.
- Fix a crash when there is no general pasteboard.
- Improve performance when a tmux window has a lot of tabs.
- Setting the background image via an escape sequence is now disabled when the
  terminal is marked untrusted in advanced prefs.
- Make the scure input menu item indicate the true state of secure input, even
  if another app has turned it on.
- Remember the width that the tab bar was dragged to when it's on the left.

New Features:
- Add regular expression substitution to the advanced paste window.
- Offer to install utilities (currently imgcat and it2dl, which downloads
  files) when you install shell integration.
- Add a new custom escape sequence. OSC 1337 ; ReportCellSize ST will respond
  with OSC 1337 ; ReportCellSize= H ; W ST where H and W are floating point
  values giving the height and width of a cell, respectively.
- Parse /etc/auto_master to find NFS automounts and ignore them for semantic
  history because they tend to be slow to statfs().
- Add Select Current Command to the Edit menu. It selects the command at the
  current command line. It requires that Shell Integration be installed.
- Set TERM_SESSION_ID and TERM_PROGRAM_VERSION for compatibility with
  Terminal.app's standard.

Improvements to Automatic Profile Switching:
- Fix a bug where Automatic Profile Switching rules were scored incorrectly.
  Longer rules now outrank shorter rules ceteris paribus, as they always should
  have.
- Add support for "sticky" Automatic Profile Switching rules. A sticky rule
  begins with ! and will stay in effect after its rules no longer match
(provided no other APS rule matches).
- Add support for wildcards in path names in Automatic Profile Switching rules.

Visual Improvements:
- Modernize the look of the Open Quickly window.
- Improve the visual appearance of inactive tabs with colors.
- Left-align tab labels when the tab bar is on the left.
- Add high-contrast themes.

New Preferences:
- Add a checkbox to Window preferences to make non-default background colors
  always opaque.
- Add an advanced preference to disable dictionary lookup on force press.
- Add an advanced preference to specify directories to ignore for semantic
  history.
- Add an off-by-default advanced preference to redraw the screen after Clear
  Buffer is selected.
- Add an advanced preference that makes cmd-click invoke semantic history even
  when iTerm2 is not the active app.

Minor bug fixes:
- Fix a bug where open quickly would not search the names of sessions that had
  been renamed in Get Info.
- Improve how the bold version of your font is chosen.
- Fix a bug where non-anti-aliased underlines were too thick.
- Change how the view is redrawn. It now redraws 30 times per second when
  active. Previously it did some really complicated, poorly understood, and
  probably buggy things with adaptive rates.
- Fix a bug where the hamburger menu's Restart Session item would restart the
  tab's current session, not the session associated with the menu.
- Improve signal handling for shells without job control by making the session
  retoration server a process group leader.
- Fix a bug where trying to tmux -CC attach to a tmux server without a session
  would cause us to write a command to the shell prompt.
- Fix a bug where the activity indicator in a tab wouldn't appear with a dark
  theme, sometimes.
- Reduce CPU usage in certain cases by not drawing tab labels and computing
  their sizes excessively.
- Improve predictability of restoring the default window arrangement.
- Fix a bug where user names were not properly escaped as an argument to login.
- Fix a bug where moving a selection's endpoint by one character with the
  keyboard would move it by two sometimes.
- Fix a bug in how selected text is reported to accessibility.
- Fix a bug where option-click to move the cursor didn't handle double-width
  characters properly.
- Fix a bug where an unterminated DCS code would cause output to be consumed
  indefinitely. Now we stop when we get a control character besides ESC or
  non-ASCII text.
- Pass -q to login if ~/.hushlogin exists. Fixes an issue where open a session
  in a directory other than your home directory would not respect hushlogin.
- Improve the appearance of top-right indicators when timestamps are being
  drawn.
- Allow windows without a title bar to be miniaturized.
- Fix the colors of Advanced Preferences when the preferences panel is not key.
- Fix a bug where right mouse clicks were reported incorrectly.
- Update TextMate's bundle identifier for the new version with captial letters.
- Make the custom escape sequence SetBackgroundImageFile with an empty name
  remove the background image.
- Fix a bug where launching Atom with shell integration would open two files.
- Fix a bug where the current prompt loses the link to its mark when a window
  is resized with bash.
- Improve the visual appearance of marks, especially with larger fonts.
- Highlight marks in red when they have an error code when navigating to them.
- Make the confirmation click prompt to disable tip of the day more noticeable.

<pre id="changelist160932837419468639" style="display: none">tl;dr: Lots of bugs fixed. Significant changes to automatic profile swiitching.
Miscellaneous small new features added.

Major Changes:
- Change how Automatic Profile Switching to keep a stack of profiles. When no
  APS rule is matches the current state, we pop profiles from the stack until it
  has only one or we find one whose rule matches.
- Update to libssh2 version 1.7.0. Fixes a bug where known_hosts entries got
  clobbered and adds new algorithms.

New Prefs:
- Add an advanced setting to disable escape sequences that could be misused by
  untrusted content. Issue 4229.
- Add a new advanced setting to control how many bytes of context are used in
  semantic history. Issue 4399.

Updates to Semantic History:
- Treat IP addresses and hostnames with at least two components as URLs for
  semantic history. Issue 4281.
- When opening a file from semantic history, if no app is able to handle opening
  the file offer the user the option to pick an app and associate it as the
  default viewer. Issue 4281.
- Strip enclosing parentheses, angle brackets, square brackets, apostrophes, and
  quotes from filenames in sementic history (used to be just parens).

Other Improvements:
- Left-side tab bar can now be dragged wider or narrower. Issue 4270.
- When dragging a file to upload with scp into iTerm2, indicate the various drop
  targets' username, hostname, and destination directory.

  strip the trailing newline.
- Rename the trigger action 'Set Directory' and 'Set Host and User' to reduce
  confusion. Allow 'Report Host and User' to report only the host ("@hostname")
  or only the user ("username@").
- Replace \n and \xXX in the badge with newline and an ascii value.
- Add a "Don't Ask Again" option to the offer to restart a session.
- Show a warning when we fail to connect to a remote host for scp with a help
  button that takes you to the wiki article explaining how to fix it.
- If you enter a query beginning with "/a", "/f", "/p", or "/t" in the Open
  Quickly window then results are restricted to window arrangements, searching
  sessions, switching profiles, and opening tabs, respectively.
- Automatically detect when you're tryiing to use the scroll wheel to move
  through a document in alternate screen mode and offer to change the setting.
- Add support for a custom CSI code: CSI 1337 n. We'll report a string of 'CSI
  ITERM2 versionnumber n'. This is useful for detecting that iTerm2 version 3 is
  running in a way that's compatible with other terminals.

Big Bugs Fixed:
- Fix a bug where automatic profile switching didn't work in fullscreen.
- Fix a bug where moving a horizontal splitter would sometimes not work.

- Fix a bug where Do Not Remap key actions didn't work. Issue 4284.

Little Bugs Fixed:

  into its own window's tab bar caused the window to close. Issue 4189.
- Fix misalginment of tab close button when pressed.
- Fix various memory leaks.
- Make terminal first responder after double-clicking in command history.
- Fix a bug where windows restored at startup into fullscreen wouldn't have
  blurred backgrounds when fullscreen was exited. Issue 4269.
- Don't check the nonstandard file ~/.ssh/ssh_config for scp transfers. Issue
  3690.
- Make a reset (by Cmd-R) of the terminal restore the cursor guide to its state
  as specified by the profile, not always off. Issue 4272
- Fix a bug where renaming a profile while the profile list view is sorted
  alphabetically would change the selected profile. Issue 4085.
- Don't make a hidden hotkey window key when the app becomes active, focus
  follows mouse is on, and the mouse happens to be over the frame of the hotkey
  window. Issue 4260.
- Fix a bug where the pencil icon would not appear if growl notifications were
  off. Issue 4255.

- When you Undo Close a session with a broken pipe, show the offer to restart
  it.
- Fix a bug where the butter bar views leaked.
- Fix a bug where the broken pipe red lines would disappear sometimes.

  well) composed of more than one ideograph didn't select the full word on
  double click. Issue 4325.
- Don't draw the same timestamp over and over on consecutive lines. Indicate
  repeating timestamps with a double line. Increase the alpha value of the
  timestamp background to 90%. Issue 4333.
- Fix a bug where Search fields in the toolbelt would try to autocomplete for
  some users.

<pre id="changelist3487051180215838353" style="display: none">There are a lot of new features in the version 3.0 beta release. It represents
about eighteen months of development. These are just the highlights.

- iTerm2 has been updated for the new Mac OS X Yosemite flat look and is
  stunningly beautiful.

- Shell Integration is a modification to your shell's login script that informs
  iTerm2 of which commands you're running, which host you're logged in to, what
  your user name is, and what your current directory is. This enables all kinds
  of cool features, such as easily navigating to preceding shell prompts,
  getting a notification when a long-running job finishes, drag-dropping files
  to upload and download on remote hosts, and much more. All the details are at
  the <a href="/shell_integration.html">Shell Integration</a> document.

- Session Restoration allows your jobs to keep running after iTerm2 upgrades, is
  force-quit, or crashes. It's like tmux without tmux!

- Using the <a href="/imgcat">imgcat</a> script, iTerm2 can display image files
  right in the terminal--even animated GIFs. See the <a
  href="/images.html">Inline Images</a> document for details.

- The built-in Password Manager saves you from having to remember lots of
  passwords. It uses Mac OS's keychain to securely store them, and has built-in
  guards to prevent them from being accidentally transmitted when not at a
  password prompt. You can even write a Trigger that automatically opens the
  Password Manager at the password prompt.

- Undo closing sessions, tabs, and windows. If you close a session by accident,
  you get five seconds to hit Cmd-Z to undo it.

- Have lots of tabs? Put the tab bar on the left. Quickly search them by recent
  commands, directories, current host name, profile name, and more with the Open
  Quickly feature.

- Dynamic Profiles allow you to store profiles in JSON files. This is really
  handy if you have lots of profiles or want to auto-generate them. See the
  <a href="/dynamic-profiles.html">Dynamic Profiles</a> document for details.

- Never lose your cursor. An optional cursor guide highlights the entire row
  your cursor is on and Cursor Boost dims all colors other than the cursor to
  make it really stand out.

- Performance is greatly improved by parsing the incoming bytes off the main
  thread. Hundreds of bugs have been fixed. Lots of details have been improved:
  for example, if you print a binary file to the console, you're offered the
  option to silence the bell. You can edit strings before you paste them.  You get
  warned before pasting tabs at your shell prompt. And much more!
