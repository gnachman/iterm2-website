### Split Panes
Divide a tab up into multiple panes, each one showing a different session. You can slice vertically and horizontally and create any number of panes in any imaginable arrangement.

Notice how inactive panes are slightly dimmed so it's easy to see which is active.

### Hotkey Window
Register a hotkey that brings iTerm2 to the foreground when you're in another application. A terminal is always a keypress away. You can choose to have the hotkey open a dedicated window. This gives you an always-available terminal (like Visor, Guake, or Yakuake) at your fingertips.

<section class="feature-block">
<a name="24-bit-colors"></a>
### 24-bit Color
With both 24-bit and 256-color mode, Vim explodes with photorealism: the terminal is a medley of color and code comes alive.

<section class="feature-block">
<a name="readability"></a>
### Readability

<section class="feature-block">
<a name="tagged-profiles"></a>

Do you need to store separate configurations for many different hosts? iTerm2 provides a taggable and searchable profiles database so you can easily find the profile you're looking for.

<section class="feature-block">
<a name="triggers"></a>
### Triggers
iTerm2 supports user-defined triggers, which are actions that run when text matching a regular expression is received. You can use it to highlight words, automatically respond to prompts, notify you when something important happens, and more.
<img src="img/screenshots/triggers.png" class="linkless-image">

</section>
<section class="feature-block">
<a name="smart-selection"></a>
### Smart Selection
iTerm2 can perform "smart selection" to highlight URLs, email addresses, filenames, and more by recognizing what is under the cursor and choosing how much text to select.

<section class="feature-block">
<a name="shell-integration"></a>
### Shell Integration
iTerm2 can integrate with your shell so it knows where your shell prompt is, what commands you're entering, which host you are on, and what your current directory is. This enables all sorts of cool features: you can easily navigate to previous shell prompts with &#8679;&#8984;&uarr; and &#8679;&#8984;&darr;. Your most used directories will be remembered for you. You can auto-complete previously used commands. And much more!

</section>

<section class="feature-block">
<a name="automatic-profile-switching"></a>
### Automatic Profile Switching
Using the Shell Integration feature, you can have iTerm2 switch profiles depending on what you're doing. For example, you can define a profile that's always used when you ssh to some hostname. Or when your username is root. Or even when you're in a particular directory.

<section class="feature-block">
<a name="inline-images"></a>
### Inline Images
iTerm2 has a custom escape sequence to display images right in the terminal. Even animated GIFs!

</section>

<section class="feature-block">
<a name="timestamps"></a>
### Timestamps
You can see the last-modified time of every line in the terminal. It's useful to know how long a job took to complete, if the data you're looking at is fresh, or to try to piece together what you were doing before leaving for the weekend.

<section class="feature-block">
<a name="password-manager"></a>
### Password Manager
Do you find yourself typing your password over and over again? Do you need to remember a bunch of passwords? Use iTerm2's built-in password manager. It stores your data securely encrypted in macOS's keychain, protected by your user account's password. iTerm2 includes a safety mechanism that ensures your password only gets entered at a password prompt.

<img src="img/screenshots/password_manager.png" class="linkless-image">
</section>

<section class="feature-block">
<a name="advanced-paste"></a>
### Advanced Paste
With the Advanced Paste feature you can edit text before pasting it, convert it to base64, transform special characters, and more.

</section>

<section class="feature-block">
<a name="annotations"></a>
### Annotations
You can select text in your terminal and add an *annotation* to it in iTerm2. If you're puzzling through a big log file, it's useful to mark it up with what you've learned. Working through a disassembly? Make notes about what each register does. Free your mind!

</section>

<section class="feature-block">
<a name="badges"></a>
### Badges
You can put a *badge* in the top right of your terminal showing information about the current session. It can show your username, hostname, or even custom data like the current git branch.

<section class="feature-block">
<a name="captured-output"></a>
### Captured Output
Use iTerm2 as your IDE. When you build a big project, you used to have to pore over its output to find warnings and errors. No more! With the *captured output* feature, iTerm2 finds those messages (based on regular expressions you define) and shows them in the toolbelt. You can navigate right to each message. A double-click will run a coprocess of your choice, which can (for example) open the file in your favorite editor right to the line with the error.
