title: Applescript - iTerm2 - Mac OS Terminal Replacement
---

## Applescript

This is an example of the new Applescript syntax available in versions 2.9 and up.

Please note that as of 2.9.20150414, "terminal window" has been replaced with "window" to improve compliance with standard Applescript conventions.
