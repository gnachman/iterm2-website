3.5.5beta2, built on September 19, 2024.

New Features
- Snippet search now supports using | as logical
  OR.

Improvements
- The option key now acts as Alt rather than Meta
  for keystrokes like function keys and arrows.
  This fixes some things like option-arrow in
  Emacs and probably breaks other workflows.
  You can revert to the old behavior with the
  profile setting "Treat ⌥ as Alt".
- Improvements to how tmux window sizing works.
  This is the new behavior:

  When attaching to an existing session:
    If "When attaching, restore windows as" is set
    to "Tabs in the attaching window", the window
    will not resize. Tabs are just added.

    Otherwise, restore previous tmux window sizes.

  When creating a new tab:
    The window will not to resize (unless a tab
    bar comes or goes).

  When creating a new window:
    The window size in the profile under the
    Window tab is respected.
- 1Password Credentials with the tag iTerm2 are
  now usable in the password manager when the
  1Password integration is enabled.
- Disable the menu shown when you hover or
  right-click on the window's zoom button because
  it caused a lot of hangs. You can reenable it
  with an advanced setting.
- Asciicast logs now include resize events.
- o1-preview and o1-mini OpenAI models added.

Bug Fixes
- Fix a very frequent crash.
- Fix a bug where "apps can change how keys are
  reported" was not always respected.
