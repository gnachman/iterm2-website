- Clear Buffer can now be broadcast like keyboard
  input.
- The tab bar in the Minimal theme now uses the

  you can use literal text without worrying about
  backslashes.

  Advanced Paste for editing.

  setting instead of an advanced setting.

Bug Fixes
- Fix a bug where some apps would use the wrong
  colors because of a terminfo problem.
- Fix a bug where using the contextual menu to
  hide a Python API-provided status bar component
  could hide the wrong one.
- Fix a bug where fish could be confused about the
  size of a new session.
- Fix a bug where expanding a disclosure triangle
  in an alert box didn't increase its size,
  leaving the text unreadable.
- Widen prefs panel so legacy scrollbars don't
  overlap controls.
- ESC c (RIS) now restores colors from the
  underlying profile, including those changed by
  OSC 4.
