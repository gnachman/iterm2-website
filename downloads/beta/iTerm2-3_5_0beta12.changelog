3.5.0beta12

This release was built using XCode 15, which will
either make it work better in Sonoma or introduce
inexplicable bugs. Probably both, come to think of
it.

New featuers:
* Recently used profiles are added to the dock
  menu as recent documents.
* Add Unicode 15 emoji.
* Use the running program's first letter as the
  tab icon if there is no built-in icon.

Bug fixes:
* Fix a memory corruption bug that caused a lot of
  crashes.
* Fix various crashes.
* Fix a memory leak.
* Update minimum contrast when dark mode changes.
* Support multi-line prompts when showing an
  offscreen command line at the top of the screen.
* Fix wrong underlines in offscreen command
  lines.
* Sanitize paths in x-man-page URLs.

Other improvements:
* Increase width of font picker panel to avoid
  truncation.
* Provide a more helpful error if a profile's
  command cannot be found.
* Strip control characters from RemoteHost.
* Warn before connecting via scp to a
  never-before-seen host.
* Add NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription so apps that
  use your photo library get a proper permission
  dialog.
* Don't close or clear composer when executing a
  command and auto composer is not enabled.
* Use more modern OpenAI APIs.
* Improve performance of window title setting.
