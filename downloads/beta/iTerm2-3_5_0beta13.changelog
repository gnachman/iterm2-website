3.5.0beta13

Beta 13 is exactly the same as beta 12 except for
it doesn't crash on launch in Sonoma.

This release was built using XCode 15, which will
either make it work better in Sonoma or introduce
inexplicable bugs. Probably both, come to think of
it.

New featuers:
* Recently used profiles are added to the dock
  menu as recent documents.
* Add Unicode 15 emoji.
* Use the running program's first letter as the
  tab icon if there is no built-in icon.

Bug fixes:
* Fix a memory corruption bug that caused a lot of
  crashes.
* Fix various crashes.
* Fix a memory leak.
* Update minimum contrast when dark mode changes.
* Support multi-line prompts when showing an
  offscreen command line at the top of the screen.
* Fix wrong underlines in offscreen command
  lines.
* Sanitize paths in x-man-page URLs.

Other improvements:
* Increase width of font picker panel to avoid
  truncation.
* Provide a more helpful error if a profile's
  command cannot be found.
* Strip control characters from RemoteHost.
* Warn before connecting via scp to a
  never-before-seen host.
* Add NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription so apps that
  use your photo library get a proper permission
  dialog.
* Don't close or clear composer when executing a
  command and auto composer is not enabled.
* Use more modern OpenAI APIs.
* Improve performance of window title setting.
