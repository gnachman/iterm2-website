Version 3.6.0beta1 of iTerm2 was built on July 28, 2025

Only macOS 12 and later are supported for this
release. Sorry :(

New Features:
- iTerm2 is now a web browser as well as a
  terminal emulator! In Settings > Profiles >
  General, set "Profile Type" to "Web Browser".
  Many existing features already work in browser
  sessions, such as key bindings, smart selection,
  navigation, open quickly, focus follows mouse,
  and the password manager. Form filling, adblock,
  reader mode, and removal of distracting elements
  are already there. More will come as we progress
  towards a stable release of 3.6.0.

Other Improvements:
- Anthropic is now available as an AI provider.
- Delay sending text at start until the window
  finishes entering full screen mode.
- Tildes are now expanded in the folder for
  automatic logging.
- Various performance improvements.
- Automatic profile switching job rules now match
  against the full command line as well as just
  the job name.
- Draw cursor guide over powerline glyphs when
  native powerling glyphs are enabled.
- Don't require keychain access to open settings
  window.
- Background colors now extend all the way to the
  edges by default. You can disable this with
  Settings > Advanced > Extend background color into
  margins in alternate screen mode.

Bug Fixes:
- Fix crashes.
- Fix a bug where relative timestamps could be
  incorrect.
- Fix a crashw hen right clicking in some text
  fields in settings.
- Fix crazy weird animations when animating cursor
  movement.
- Make "fold to named mark" pick the last mark
  with a given name.
- Fix a bug where folding to named mark would
  sometimes place the collapsed line in the wrong
  place.
- Fix a bug where an invisible composer window
  could be left behind, preventing you from
  clicking on the top of the terminal.
- Don't add snippets to the top level menu if they
  have tags.
- Fix a crash when modifying a dynamic profile
  through the settings UI.
