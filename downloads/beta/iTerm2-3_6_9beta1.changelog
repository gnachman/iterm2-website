Version 3.6.9beta1 was built on February 27, 2026.

New Features:
- Add Edit > Fold All, which makes it easy to
  collapse everything that's happened so far to
  focus on what you're working on.
- When you use sudo and get a password prompt,
  you'll get an offer to enable touch ID.
- Added "input buffering", which is a feature that
  stores what you type in a buffer temporarily.
  You can toggle it with Shell > Toggle Buffer
  Input. It can be enabled or disabled by a
  trigger, and sessions can start with input
  buffering enabled by default with a new setting
  in Settings > Profile > Session.
- Added a setting in Profiles > Colors to match
  colors in the 8-bit colorspace to your ANSI
  colors.
- The tab color menu has been extended to add a
  color picker and to recall recent colors.
- Added a pointer action to copy hyperlink
  address.
- Input method editor text color is now
  configurable.
- You can now enable an "active pane" border which
  makes it easier to tell which pane of a window
  is focused.
- There is a new control sequence to append a
  clickable button that sends a control sequence
  when activated:
  OSC 1337 ; Button=type=custom;code=N;icon=ICON ST
  Where N is a positive integer code identifying
  the button, ICON is an SF Symbol name like
  "star.fill", and ST is ESC \ or BEL.
  When clicked, iTerm2 sends back:
  ESC [ ? 1337 ; N ~
- Added control seqeunce to fold/unfold blocks.
  OSC 1337 ; UpdateBlock=id=BLOCKID;action=ACTION ST
  Where ACTION is "fold" or "unfold"
- Added the option to show offscreen command line
  for the current command.
- Add Lock Size feature to prevent window resizing
  via menu item and per-profile preference.
- Added support for Bitwarden integration in
  password manager.
- When broadcasting input you can mark a session
  as a "broadcast source" which means you can type
  in it to send to others, but those sessions not
  marked as sources ignore keyboard input.
- Add a new key binding action to send text
  without braodcasting key binding action.
- Any boolean or color profile setting can be set
  to take its value from an expression using the
  same syntax as interpolated strings. Right click
  on a checkbox in profile settings, click "bind to
  exprsesion", and enter an expression like
  "user.mySetting". See the docs on Scripting
  Fundamentals and Scripting Variables for more
  details.
- Add a new control sequence to set a profile
  property.
  ESC ] 1337 ; SetProfileProperty=KEY1=VALUE1[;KEY2=VALUE2...] ST
  KEY = profile property name (e.g., "Cursor
    Type", "Blinking Cursor")
  VALUE = base64-encoded JSON value
  ST = string terminator (ESC \ or BEL)
- Add menu item to tabbar context menu to open new
  tab next to current tab/at end.
- Most window types can now be configured to have
  an initial size that is a percentage of screen
  size rather than a fixed number of rows/columns.
- You can now run multiple instances of iTerm2
  concurrently with separate configurations by
  passing `-suite <some unique name>` when
  launching iTerm2 by executing
  iTerm2.app/Contents/MacOS/iTerm2 directly with
  that command line argument.
- Move 'new tabs open at end of tabbar' out of
  advanced settings.


Improvements:
- iTerm2 now responds to OSC 52 queries when using
  tmux integration with tmux 3.6.
- Support git diff index/worktree path prefixes in
  semantic history
- Add repair button to fix key bindings corrupted
  by keycode 0 bug in versions 3.4.x-3.5.x.
- Add option to preserve window size on tab bar
  visibility change only when resizing would push
  window off-screen.
- Add session variable isBroadcastSource.
- Add a setting to suppress notifications from the
  active session.
- Add support for arithmetic expressions and
  comparison using the ternary operator ?: in
  interpolated strings.
- Add pane locking to prevent accidental
  drag/drop. You can toggle it in the terminal's
  context menu or the per-pane title bar's menu.

  reporting.

- Searching for multiline queries now works
  reliably.
- Improve the appearance of terminal buttons.
- Improve placeholder text contrast in search and
  filter fields.
- Remember user-set colors separately from those
  set by control sequences so when a control
  sequence resets colors it doesn't override the
  user's manually set value.
- Clear Script Console text views when window
  closes to prevent unbounded memory growth.
- Scroll command marks to top of view instead of
  centering when navigating with Previous/Next
  Mark.
- Show a message in settings when no profile is
  selected.
- Tab dragging is now much smoother and tabs fight
  against leaving their tabbar a little bit.

  tab when both are very busy.
- Make tmux attaching window/tab setting sane.
- Offer to restore titles when an ssh session
  ends.

- Show smart selection action URL on hover.
- Tweak position and spacing of stoplight buttons
  in minimal in macOS 26.
- Make the Open Profiles window move to the
  current Space to avoid switching spaces when you
  try to use it.

  with custom tab bar height on macOS 26, and in
 Compact theme.

  EOL.

  prompt marks, not trigger-created marks.

  rejecting paths containing /dev/ as a
  subdirectory.
- Fix bug with ctrl+option keypresses being
  misreported as just option in modifyOtherKeys
  mode.
- Fix overly strict base64 decoding in KittyImageController.
- Fix bugs with progress bars: they were hidden
  behind per-pane title bars and the validation
  block was wrong which prevented SetProfileProperty
  from working.
- Fix Kitty protocol a=T (transmit+display) with
  identifier=0
- Don't rewrite SGR 3 to SGR 7 in tmux integration
  when TERM matches *tmux*. This should fix
