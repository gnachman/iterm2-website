3.5.1beta2

This beta adds some safety valves to eliminate the
risk of private information leaving the terminal
via the AI endpoints. While an API key and
explicit user action were always needed to use AI
features, some users asked for an impenetrable
firewall for safety and regulatory purposes.

To that end, there are three relevant changes:

1. Code that communicates with AI providers has
been moved into a plugin that you must install
separately. Enterprise system admins can block
bundle id com.googlecode.iterm2.iTermAI to prevent
it from being installed in the first place.

See here for details:
https://iterm2.com/ai-plugin.html

2. In addition, you must manually enable AI
features in Settings. Doing so requires admin
access.

3. Administrators who wish to disable iTerm2's AI
access may set the user default GenerativeAIAllowed
to False in their MDM systems.

New Features
- Cmd-shift-click on a command's output to select
  it.

Improvements
- Prompts for Codecierge are now in advanced
  settings.
- Scroll-to-end keybindings are now broadcast when
  input broadcasting is on.
- Previously it was easy to choose a locale
  without the right character encoding. Detect
  this and offer a chance to try again.
- For users who did fall into this trap, ask them
  to try again.
- Various controls for AI have been moved to the
  main Settings panel so it's easier to use a
  local model.
- Add an advanced setting to disable the secure
  keyboard entry indicator.
- Indicators get an outline to make them stand out
  from the background.
- Codecierge gets a larger text box to enter your
  goal.
- Various powerline characters no longer respond
  to minimum contrast so their colors can match
  adjacent background colors.

Bug Fixes
- Fix gpt-4o support which had too many response
  tokens.
- Support responses from LLMs without an index
  field.
- Fix a bug where there were stray pixels above
  some characters.
- Fix alignment of box-drawing characters in GPU
  renderer.
- Control-[ closes the find bar when it's in the
  status bar.
- Fix a bug where modifier remapping didn't work
  with some actions such as cmd-clicking links.
- The "offscreen command line" shown at the top
  when part of a command's output is truncated now
  includes the background colors of the command
  line.
- Fix a bug where focus-follows-mouse didn't
  activate a window when the cursor only enters
  the scrollbar.
- Fix a bug where the background image could
  overflow the bounds of the image control and
  fill the settings window. It was a very pretty
  bug.
- Fix discrepancies between GPU and legacy
  renderers that drew things in different orders.
- Fix a crash with the smart selection action "run
  command in window".
- Fix bugs in dragging dividers between tools in
  Toolbelt.
