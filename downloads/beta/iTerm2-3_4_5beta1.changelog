3.4.5beta1

New Features:
- Add preference to allow/disallow apps changing
  the function of the option keys with a control
  sequence.
- Add a menu item to pop the current session into
  a new window.
- The git status bar now indicates the repo state
  (merging, reverting, cherrypicking, bisecting,
  rebasing, or applying).
- When you right click on a hex color like #ffeedd
  show a preview of the color in sRGB in the
  context menu.
- Add a new type of trigger to highlight the whole
  line. This is useful because matching .*foo.* is
  very slow. With this trigger you can simply
  match foo and the whole line changes color.

Improvements
- The git status bar component no longer shells
  out to the system git. It uses libgit2 instead
  (nicely named!) and should be faster and more
  reliable now.
- When known, the current git branch is used as a
  search feature in Open Quickly.
- Don't show a line between the titlebar and
  tabbar in Big Sur.
- Increase max allowed blur on macOS 10.14.
- When you move a window to a different screen by
  selecting the Move To Screen menu item, it will
  lose its affinity for the window assigned to it
  in Prefs > Profiles > Window and stay where it
  was put when screens are added or removed.
- Buttons in modal alerts now accept cmd+letter
  shortcuts.
- Ignore dynamic profiles whose filename ends in a
  tilde.
- Reset terminal when relaunching a session (e.g.,
  paste bracketing and mouse reporting).
- The composer window now uses the terminal's
  font.
- Scrolling with the trackpad should be more
  responsive now.
- Change how text is drawn when not using GPU
  renderer to avoid artifacts.
- When doing selection respecting soft boundaries,
  treat a backslash in the last column as a
  continuation mark and don't include it.
- By default, save terminal contents to history
  when there is a scrolling region that touches
  the top of the screen.
- Newly saved window arrangements will restore to
  the right size when scroller style changes after
  they were created (unless there are side-by-side
  split panes).
- Treat soft hyphens as unicode punctuation in
  Advanced Paste.

  titlebar didn't maximize tmux panes correctly.

  sent the wrong code.

  trackpad touches.

  HTML for window title and tooltips.

  vertically on macOS 10.14.
