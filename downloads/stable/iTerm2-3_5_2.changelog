3.5.2

This version of iTerm2 patches a security issue
present in previous builds of 3.5, including
betas. Please upgrade right away.

The issue has been assigned CVE-2024-38396.

Bug Fixes
---------
- Fix a bug where the "Terminal may report window
  title" setting was not respected. This makes a
  remote code execution attack possible.
- Disable controls in Settings when generative AI
  is disabled in advanced settings or by MDM.


Since 3.5.1 was a short-lived release, the release
notes for 3.5.1 follow:

3.5.1

This release adds some safety valves to eliminate
the risk of private information leaving the
terminal via the AI endpoints. While an API key
and explicit user action were always needed to use
AI features, some users asked for an impenetrable
firewall for safety and regulatory purposes.

To that end, there are three relevant changes:

1. Code that communicates with AI providers such
as OpenAI has been moved into a plugin that you
must install separately. Enterprise system admins
can block bundle id com.googlecode.iterm2.iTermAI
to prevent it from being installed in the first
place.

See here for details:
https://iterm2.com/ai-plugin.html

2. In addition, you must manually enable AI
features in Settings. Doing so requires admin
access.

3. Enterprise administrators who wish to disable
iTerm2's AI access may set the user default
GenerativeAIAllowed to False in their MDM systems.


New Features
------------
- Cmd-shift-click on a command's output to select
  it.

Improvements
------------
- Previously it was easy to choose a locale
  without the right character encoding. Detect
  this and offer a chance to try again. For users
  who did fall into this trap, ask them to try
- Add an option to use LC_CTYPE=UTF-8 as your
  locale.
- Keypresses in SSH integration no longer wait for
  one to ACK before the next is sent.
- Move OpenAI API key to the keychain.
- Add gpt-4o model.
- Fix drag-drop to upload with SSH integration
  when using ~/.ssh/config where Host isn't equal
  to Hostname.
- Prompts for Codecierge are now in advanced
  settings.
- Scroll-to-end keybindings are now broadcast when
  input broadcasting is on.
- Various controls for AI have been moved to the
  main Settings panel so it's easier to use a
  local model.
- Add an advanced setting to disable the secure
  keyboard entry indicator.
- Indicators get an outline to make them stand out
  from the background.
- Codecierge gets a larger text box to enter your
  goal.
- Various powerline characters no longer respond
  to minimum contrast so their colors can match
  adjacent background colors.
- Improve error reporting in AI code.
- Make canceling an AI request work faster.
- Only ask for accessibility permission once per
  app version.
- Use selection color to outline selected command.
- Add a setting to disable horizontal scroll
  reporting. This fixes a problem where swiping to
  switch tabs didn't work when mouse reporting was
  on.

Bug Fixes
- Fix a bug where adding items to the password
  manager would overwrite other items.
- Fix a bug where the background image could
  overflow the bounds of the image control and
  fill the settings window. It was a very pretty
  bug.
- Fix a bug where autocomplete didn't work at all.
- Fix a bug in it2ssh when connecting to hosts
  that don't use bash as /bin/sh.
- Fix crashes.
- Fix a performance problem with long scrollback
  history. Existing history will need to be
  cleared before the benefit is seen.
- Fix double-paste when drag-dropping text.
- Fix support for non-OpenAI LLMs.
- Typing while it2ssh is connecting no longer
  breaks it.
- Fix performance issue with very long window
  titles.
- Fix gpt-4o support which had too many response
  tokens.
- Support responses from LLMs without an index
  field.
- Fix a bug where there were stray pixels above
  some characters.
- Fix alignment of box-drawing characters in GPU
  renderer.
- Control-[ closes the find bar when it's in the
  status bar.
- Fix a bug where modifier remapping didn't work
  with some actions such as cmd-clicking links.
- The "offscreen command line" shown at the top
  when part of a command's output is truncated now
  includes the background colors of the command
  line.
- Fix a bug where focus-follows-mouse didn't
  activate a window when the cursor only enters
  the scrollbar.
- Fix discrepancies between GPU and legacy
  renderers that drew things in different orders.
- Fix a crash with the smart selection action "run
  command in window".
- Fix bugs in dragging dividers between tools in
  Toolbelt.
- Fix a bug where scroll-to-end keybindings didn't
  work.
- Fix a bug where tab or window titles sometimes
  wouldn't show the current job's name.
- Rename preferences to settings in tip of the
  day.
