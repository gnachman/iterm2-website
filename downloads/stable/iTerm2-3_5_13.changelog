Version 3.5.12 of iTerm2 was built on April 3, 2025

New Features:
- In apps that support the new key reporting
  protocol (notably neovim) you can now map
  keys to Hyper, Super, and Meta. Look in
  Settings > Profiles > Keys > General.
- You can now opt to highlight non-default values
  in settings. Toggle it with the dropdown menu on
  the loupe in the settings search bar.
- You can now share triggers. Select one or more
  triggers in Settings and click the Share button
  on the bottom.
- You can now modify a profile in a saved
  arrangement with
  Session > Change Profile in Arrangement.
- Cursor movement can now be animated, making it
  easier to track cursor location. Enable Animate
  Movement in profiles text settings.
- You can now drag the composer window vertically.
- Added a new trigger to set a named mark.
- Added a new trigger to fold a section of
  terminal contents.

Other Improvements:
- Fix a hang on machines with contested GPU memory
  when using the GPU renderer.
- The zoom button menu is now enabled by default.
- Improve performance when uploading large files
  or pasting enormous strings.
- Some menu items moved around to reduce the size
  of the Window menu.
- You can now disable the secure keyboard input
  indicator by clicking on it and then following a
  link in the popover.
- When using a directory from Directory History at
  the prompt, escape characters like space.
- There's a new advanced setting to enable
  right-to-left text in alternate screen mode.
- The Terminal.app Compatibility key presets have
  been updated for parity.
- The Command field in profile settings can now be
  expanded so you have more room to edit long
  commands.
- OpenAI's reasoning models are now supported.
- Fix wrong hash algorithm name in "known host"
  message when using scp.
- If tmux doesn't respond to a request to
  disconnect in a reasonable amount of time, offer
  to forcibly disconnect.

  conflict with regular app usage, warn about it.

Bug Fixes:
- Fix a bug where filter didn't work when you have
  a status bar.

  download.

  were detached when only a single one should have
  been.

  window order was unexpected and activating a
  window might switch desktops.

  be wrong on macOS 15.

  appear outside of settings.

  could add an empty `cd` command.

  with the GPU renderer.
