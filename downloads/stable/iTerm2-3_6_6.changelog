iTerm2 version 3.6.6 was released on
November 17, 2025.

New Features:
- Added setting to show per-pane title bars when
  there is only one pane.
- If the previous release left you with red tabs
  in a tmux window, this one will offer to fix
  them.
- Add KeePassXC integration in password manager.
- There's a new key binding action to toggle a
  checkbox of your choosing in settings.
- Add support for OSC 9;4 progress bars.
- Add support for DECDSR 997 and DECSET/DECRESET
  2031 for dark mode reporting.
- Cursor animation can now be enabled always.
  Previously it only happened in interactive apps.

Improvements:
- Reduce an occasional jitter after a command
  prompt.
- Add support for symbolic hotkeys to older macOS
  versions.
- You can now switch between color spaces in the
  color picker.
- Added support for the device colorspace in the
  color picker.
- Added support for OSC 52 in DA response.
- Provide useful information when a profile's
  command fails to start.
- Improve visibility of selected tab in Tahoe when
  using tab colors.
- Improve performance of moving cursor a long
  distance with option-click.
- Fix performance issue after using search.
- When doing bracketed paste from advanced paste
  with "wait for prompt" enabled, do not include
  brackets around newlines. That way the commands
  will be sent for shells like zsh and fish.
- When a force touch could do either quicklook or
  dictionary lookup, show a disambiguation menu.
- Add support for undo/redo in "engage AI" dialog
  box.
- Add more options for how to position and size
  windows. Make the default more like 3.5.x, which
  respsected the profile's size, but using Smart
  Placement.
- AI commands can now optionally be run through
  Apple Intelligence as a safety check. If ChatGPT
  decides it wants to pwn you, this makes it a
  little harder.
- Command info now shows the number of lines of
  output.
- Baseline-relative timestamps are now
  color-coded.
- Browser will show better SSL errors.
- In tmux integration, terminal reports in
  response to OSC 1337 codes are now sent.
- Tooltips in Minimal now use the proper
  light/dark theme.
- All AI chat messages are now copyable.
- AI models updated.

Bug Fixes:
- Automatically unbury tmux integration clients
  when we can't restore the tmux session on
  attach. If you get a zillion windows on first
  launch of this version, that could be why (they
  tended to pile up).
- Fix various crashes.
- Fix $$HOST$$ and $$USER$$ substitution.
- The colorpicker's eyedropper is now smarter
  about color spaces.
- Fix a bug where images would disappear after
  folding and unfolding a region.
- Fix various graphical imperfections in Tahoe.
- Disable menu item "Move to new window" when
  there is only one tab.
- Fixed a bug where you couldn't delete
  annotations.
- Fix bugs in the status bar filter component.
- Fix UI bugs in editing triggers.
- Fix a bug where the context menu incorrectly
  characterized ssh integration downloads as scp.
- Make the stoplight buttons behave better on
  macOS 26.
- Fix a bug where ssh integration downloads would
  sometimes happen over scp.
- Fix a bug where some items were missing from the
  list of key binding actions.
